            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE whole Scripture is a <hi>Field,</hi> wherein Rich <hi>Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge</hi> are <hi>hid,</hi> and yet not hid so, but that they may be <hi>found</hi> and possess't, by those that <hi>seek</hi> and <hi>search for</hi> them, <hi>as such,</hi> in a due Manner, and to right Ends. How far it may be allowed, to make <hi>Comparisons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one <hi>part</hi> of Scripture and another, and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr</hi> one before another, I am not now concern'd to determine or enquire; but considering how ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry instructive <hi>all the Words</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> were, and how much valuable Truth hath been often brought forth by the elaborate Discussion of a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Sentence,</hi> I have sometimes wonder'd, that this piece of <hi>Holy Ground,</hi> hath remained hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto in so great a measure <hi>untoucht,</hi> when it deserves so well to be <hi>broken up</hi> by the most able and skilful Hand; for if I had met with any such endeavours of that kind, as the <hi>peculiarity</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:40872:3"/>the Subject seems to call for, this poor Service of mine had been never undertaken.</p>
            <p>Nor did I design, long after the first underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that it should be made thus Publick; but it should have <hi>breath'd it's last</hi> in the Pulpit, if my own Inclinations and Purposes could have prevail'd against the repeated and undeniable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests of several other Persons. However I am so far defended against the Censures, which this performance may meet with from Enemies of <hi>all sorts,</hi> that none can have meaner thoughts of it, than I have my self, even while I am over-rul'd to offer it to the World; And I account it a <hi>real Mercy,</hi> as well as my <hi>special Duty,</hi> to go thro every Work of God, with a just Sense of my own unworthiness and unfitness for it; to whom, I am Convinc'd, Those very humble <hi>Confessions</hi> of Holy <hi>Agur,</hi> at the beginning of a remarkable <hi>Prophesie, Prov. 30.2, 3.</hi> are more strictly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, than to the most.</p>
            <p>What there is of humane Infirmity and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in the Management of the Points here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, I hope, the sincere <hi>Friends of Religion</hi> will charitably excuse and overlook; what there is <hi>of God,</hi> hath a right to be receiv'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, as coming <hi>from him,</hi> notwithstanding the disadvantage of it's Delivery; for <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Oil</hi> should bear the deserved Price in our esteem, not only, when 'tis <hi>emptied out of a golden Pipe</hi> (as in the Prophet's <hi>Vision</hi>) Zech. <hi>4.12.</hi> But even tho it be as it is here, convey'd in <hi>Lead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been <hi>carried by the Stream</hi> of our Lord's Discourse in this Place, to lay open much
<pb facs="tcp:40872:3"/>of the Nature, and insist particularly on some of the Aggravations, of <hi>Hell-torments;</hi> which besides their useful tendency to the <hi>awakening</hi> of those that are stupid and secure, <hi>lying as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of a Mast,</hi> over that <hi>burning Lake,</hi> may not be unprofitable to the most sound and establisht <hi>Believers,</hi> who from hence will see the more abundant Cause of thankfulness to God for the <hi>unspeakable Gift</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and of rejoycing and triumphine in him, as their <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer</hi> from such a woful State. The Glorious <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> having <hi>put out this Fire,</hi> ought certainly to be the more <hi>pleasant</hi> to them whom he is <hi>risen upon,</hi> and who Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the Benefit of <hi>healing in his Wings;</hi> there being not one Saint in <hi>Heaven,</hi> or in <hi>Earth,</hi> but what may truly say, <q>All <hi>this</hi> Misery had been my Everlasting Lot among the worst of Sinners, if the Eternal Son of God had not been <hi>made Sin,</hi> and a <hi>Curse</hi> for me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If God will vouchsafe his Blessing upon what is written here, for the accomplishing of so good Effects, I shall <hi>have</hi> (that which I covet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Prosperity of the World) <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I may Glory through Jesus Christ, in things pertaining to God;</hi> Rom. <hi>15.17.</hi> For undoubtedly the success of our Labours, is onr most solid Reputation, and that <hi>Author</hi> hath the best and greatest <hi>Name,</hi> whose <hi>Writings</hi> are of most <hi>advantage</hi> to the Souls of Men. And therefore, tho in the Preaching of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermons, I thought not of their having any other <hi>Impression</hi> than on the Hearts of the <hi>Hearers,</hi> I do now profess my earnest Desire,
<pb facs="tcp:40872:4"/>that they may be <hi>Printed over again,</hi> upon the Mind of every <hi>Reader;</hi> leaving my solemn Supplication at the Throne of Grace, that this may be done by the <hi>Finger of God.</hi>

               <p>INtending to go over the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to speak something to it, by way of <hi>Introduction,</hi> in the general. It is much Disputed among Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Whether this be a <hi>Parable</hi> or an <hi>History,</hi> some arguing for the one, and some for the other; but there is a <hi>third</hi> sort, which go a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40872:5"/>
                  <hi>middle way,</hi> to accommodate this difference, by understanding it as a <hi>mixture</hi> of bloth; <hi>i. e.</hi> a kind of <hi>Parabolical History,</hi> or <hi>Historical Parable.</hi> It may be partly a Narrative of <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> and partly illustrated with <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial additions,</hi> which are not to be look'd upon as real things, nor stretch'd too far beyond the <hi>main design;</hi> tho every pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age will afford us proper instructions, as we shall see in the progress (if the Lord will.) The ground-work of all resembles that of <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Parable to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.1. <hi>There were two Men in one City, the one Rich and the other Poor.</hi> So here, the persons whom this Discourse hath a relation, were, a Rich and a Poor Man, remarkably distinguisht one from the other, by their Condition, not only in <hi>this</hi> World, but in the <hi>next.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This 19th <hi>v</hi> contains a Character of the former; and what is said concerning him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to two things, his <hi>Apparel,</hi> and his <hi>Diet.</hi> 1. His Apparel: <hi>[There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in Purple and fine Linen.]</hi> Such was the usual Garb of the greatest Persons. The Kings of <hi>Midian</hi> had their Purple Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.26. So <hi>Mordecai,</hi> when he went out from the Presence of the King in Royal Apparel, is described with a Garment of fine Linen and Purple, <hi>Esth.</hi> 8.15. When they led <hi>Our Lord</hi> about as a Mock-Prince, they clothed him with Purple, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.17. and <hi>fine Linen</hi> and <hi>Purple,</hi> are mentioned as the Robes of <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.16. 2. His Diet, <hi>[and fared sumptuously every day.]</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40872:5"/>the Words signifie, that he <hi>made merry,</hi> and that he <hi>lived splendidly.</hi> 1. He <hi>made merry;</hi> so the same Word is render'd in a like Case, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. <hi>Take thine ease, eat, drink and be merry.</hi> His Excesses were attended with a Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Frame; and the <hi>Song of Fools</hi> was the <hi>Musick</hi> at his Table. 2. He <hi>lived splendidly;</hi> he studied Pomp and Magnificence, Gallantry and State; and so abundance of needless cost was bestowed, and much Treasure vainly wasted to a sinful end. The <hi>aggravation</hi> of which was, that he did it <hi>day by day;</hi> it was not now and then, like <hi>Nabal's Feast,</hi> upon a rare and extraordinary occasion; but it was his constant, customary practice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intermission; like those <hi>Drunkards</hi> in the Prophet, who said, <hi>To Morrow shall be as this Day, Isa.</hi> 56.12.</p>
               <p>Observ. <hi>Pride and Luxury are such abuses of Worldly Riches, as Worldly Men are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry incident to.</hi> It was not this Man's <hi>sin,</hi> that he was <hi>rich;</hi> for 'tis possible to be rich <hi>in this World,</hi> and rich <hi>towards God</hi> too: And the <hi>Blessing of the Lord mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> some rich; therefore we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently so. Nor was it his sin, to be clothed according to his <hi>Quality,</hi> or to feed in a proportionable manner: Our Lord speaks of those that are in <hi>Kings Courts,</hi> and such like places, as being <hi>gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously apparelled,</hi> and <hi>living delicately,</hi> without passing any censure, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.25. <hi>i. e.</hi> gorgeously and delicately, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40872:6"/>with those of a <hi>meaner rank.</hi> But the <hi>sin</hi> lay here, that he made his <hi>Back</hi> and his <hi>Belly</hi> his <hi>God,</hi> and that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally, <hi>sacrific'd</hi> to both, and devoted himself, and all that he had to their service.

               <p n="1">1. Wherein this <hi>Pride</hi> consists. (1.) Tho it do not consist in <hi>rich Attire</hi> it self, yet it lies in the <hi>affectation</hi> of it. Rich Attire is as <hi>suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to persons of large Estates, as the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and coursest is to those that are of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour degree, and may as lawfully be worn; but none can <hi>affect</hi> it, without sin. So long as the heart is kept from going out after these things, 'tis well; but a fond inclination to them, makes us guilty; as the <hi>Jews</hi> are said to <hi>dote upon the images of the Chaldeans, men pourtrayed with Vermilion, exceeding in Dyed Attire upon their Heads, Ezek.</hi> 23 14, 15, 16. There are Three ways especially, whereby this <hi>sinful affectation</hi> is discover'd. (1.) By the <hi>extravagant costliness</hi> of Apparel; when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40872:6"/>persons care not how much is swallowed up (perhaps) in a <hi>particular Garment,</hi> or when the substance of an ample Revenue is put on <hi>at once.</hi> To go to the <hi>utmost</hi> of what a man may conveniently allow, and much more to <hi>outgoe</hi> the measure, is a Mark of the <hi>proud in Spirit;</hi> for humility would rather teach us to come short, and be content with somewhat less. (2.) It appears often by the <hi>vanity and gawdiness.</hi> A grave and decent <hi>habit,</hi> as well as behaviour, is the duty and practice of all that are not puffed up by a fleshly mind. The Apostle, who would have <hi>men to lift up holy hands,</hi> requires <hi>in like manner (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>)</hi> that <hi>women should adorn themselves in modest Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, with shamefac'tness and sobriety,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8, 9 This is as necessary an act of <hi>obedience,</hi> as Prayer is an act of <hi>worship. Sisera's Mother</hi> was exceeding eager, that her Son should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with a <hi>Prey of divers colours;</hi> for it is thrice repeated, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.30. which indeed was more becoming an <hi>Heathen General,</hi> than a <hi>serious Christian.</hi> One would think, that such <hi>gay Feathers</hi> should be little coveted, by them that would not be counted by God (like his <hi>heritage</hi> of old, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 12.9.) as a <hi>speckled Bird.</hi> (3.) By the <hi>variety and abundance. Five changes of Raiment</hi> were thought a very liberal Portion for <hi>Benjamin,</hi> a peculiar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, when <hi>Joseph</hi> made himself known to his <hi>brethren,</hi> and the rest had not so much, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.22. <hi>Chests</hi> of rich Apparel were the <hi>Merchandize of Tyre, Ezek.</hi> 27.24. But when <hi>vast Wardrches</hi> are the possession of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40872:7"/>person, that they may daily come forth in a <hi>new Dress,</hi> it betrays an Haughtiness not to be excus'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It consists in mens <hi>valuing of themselves</hi> upon this score: As if what they borrow from the <hi>backs</hi> or <hi>bowels</hi> of other creatures, could really <hi>commend</hi> them, or add any thing to them. It is the absurdest folly to suppose it; for while we were <hi>in honour,</hi> and retain'd our integrity, we neither had, nor needed any <hi>covering;</hi> and after that, when God made <hi>coats of skins</hi> for our first parents to clothe them with, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.21. the World was in a less depraved condition than now, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ himself, <hi>Solomon in all his glory, was not arayed like the Lillies of the field, Matth.</hi> 6.29. <hi>Nature</hi> bestows richer Garments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many things, than <hi>Art</hi> can upon us, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, unless the <hi>Soul</hi> be as well furnisht and adorn'd within, these things are but like <hi>noble Trappings</hi> on the <hi>Asses Back,</hi> which serve to render the silly Beast <hi>ridiculous.</hi> And yet notwithstanding the absurdity, it is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for men to magnifie themselves, and <hi>swell</hi> in their own imaginations, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their <hi>outsides</hi> are finer clad than other mens.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It consists in the <hi>contemning</hi> of those that are <hi>below</hi> them, and fall much short of them in this respect. The <hi>poor man in vile raiment</hi> is bidden to <hi>sit under their footstool, James</hi> 2.3. or not permitted to come <hi>o near;</hi> either quite <hi>overlookt,</hi> or look't upon with <hi>scorn,</hi> and with disdain, as an object not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40872:7"/>good enough for their <hi>lofty Eye.</hi> This shews, that Pride is in full Dominion; which blinds them from considering, how precious and amiable any <hi>Member</hi> of Christ, tho in <hi>Rags</hi> must needs be to its glorious <hi>Head;</hi> how <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness</hi> it self does <hi>not separate from his love, Rom.</hi> 8.35. God does not behold such <hi>afar off,</hi> but their foolish and ignorant despisers; he does not esteem a gallant Sinner, nor pass by a distressed Saint. God <hi>looks to him that is Poor;</hi> but the Rich and <hi>high-minded</hi> think them unworthy of their notice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It consists in a <hi>nice curiosity</hi> about their Apparel, as to that which is of <hi>least</hi> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and importance, or none at all. 'Tis Pride which is the spring and root of this: Particularly, (1.) When bare <hi>ornament</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to real <hi>service;</hi> and so a lesser end made to exclude a greater. The Rich Man's <hi>fine Linnen</hi> is not so useful for <hi>warmth,</hi> and yet Pride will hardly consult that in the <hi>coldest</hi> season; but Life must rather be hazarded, than Fancy be denied. (2.) When every <hi>Fashionable</hi> Punctilio is judg'd a <hi>necessary</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament. It was a singular advantage to the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> that their <hi>raiment waxed not old upon them for forty years,</hi> Deut. 8.4. But how <hi>uneasie</hi> would it have been to many, unless it had undergone above <hi>twice that number of alterations</hi> in such a compass, that even the making of it so often <hi>new,</hi> might have been enough to <hi>wear</hi> it out; (3.) When <hi>too great a part</hi> of our <hi>time</hi> and <hi>care</hi> is taken up about such trifling matters, The Proud
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40872:8"/>are much more accurate is their <hi>Dress,</hi> than in their <hi>Devotion;</hi> very <hi>exact</hi> as to their <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> very <hi>loose</hi> in the business of <hi>Religion.</hi> That which requires <hi>most thoughts and pains,</hi> is put off with <hi>fewest;</hi> and that which deserves the <hi>fewest,</hi> hath the <hi>most.</hi> This fault is never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, where Pride is not in power; for 'tis that which makes men extreamly <hi>solicitous,</hi> where they should be <hi>indifferent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherein this <hi>Luxury</hi> consists. 1. Tho it do not consist in the keeping of a <hi>full Table,</hi> yet it does in the <hi>loading</hi> of it with constant <hi>superfluities.</hi> The Plundering of <hi>Three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> at once, Earth, Air and Water, is all little enough to supply an <hi>Epicure</hi>'s ordinary Meal; and yet he must be a very <hi>large Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,</hi> who should reckon all this to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that <hi>Petition</hi> which Christ hath taught us, for <hi>daily bread.</hi> Now it seems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry questionable, whether we may allow our selves to make <hi>a Trade of consuming,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, what we are not allow'd to pray for; if we should <hi>ask amiss,</hi> in craving <hi>so much</hi> from God, is it not amiss to commit such <hi>havock</hi> among the good things of God, without asking? The Scripture speaks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of <hi>necessary food, Job</hi> 23.12. Nay, it goes further, to <hi>food convenient, Prov.</hi> 30.8. but to transgress all the bounds and measures both of <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>convenience,</hi> by a setled custom of <hi>profuseness,</hi> is what God condemns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In a <hi>contriv'd indulging</hi> of their own <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.</hi> Plain and wholesome food will not satisfie, as the <hi>lusting Israelites</hi> heretofore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40872:8"/>that there was <hi>nothing but Manna be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes, Numb.</hi> 11.6. Men labour to <hi>provoke</hi> and enflame a desire, which they ought rather to <hi>curb,</hi> and study the <hi>whetting of their stomachs,</hi> when the Holy Ghost calls them to <hi>put a knife to their throats, Prov.</hi> 23.2. I readily grant, that Nature may sometimes need to be assisted in this case, when persons are under bodily <hi>infirmities;</hi> as languishing <hi>Isaac</hi> spake for <hi>savoury meat, Gen.</hi> 27.4. but commonly, they that are strong and vigorous, require a <hi>Bridle,</hi> rather than a <hi>Spur;</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they count <hi>rioting</hi> a pleasure, they will not invent means to <hi>excite</hi> them to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In <hi>feeding without fear, Jude</hi> 12. as if the Mouth were to take in all that it <hi>can,</hi> or that we were not under the limitation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of any Law, but our own <hi>Will</hi> The <hi>Throat</hi> of a greedy Glutton, may be truly sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an <hi>open Spulcher,</hi> as well as that of the bloud-thirsty; it destroys multitudes of things more useful than himself, and many lives must be taken away, before that <hi>Grave</hi> will say, <hi>it hath enough.</hi> Thus the <hi>Liberty</hi> which God hath given us in the enjoyment of his creatures, is turn'd into <hi>licentiousness;</hi> Men are not only <hi>free,</hi> but <hi>wanton,</hi> and <hi>nourish their hearts, as in a day of slaughter, James</hi> 5.5. <hi>eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is made the very scope and <hi>design of living,</hi> and any <hi>degree of abstinence</hi> is a kind of <hi>death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In endeavouring to <hi>debauch those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with them.</hi> The Spirit of <hi>Intemperance</hi> generally works this way, and the instances of its working are very various. Besides, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40872:9"/>rude and <hi>barbarous</hi> practice of <hi>constraining</hi> their Guests, which obtains among some <hi>Lordly Brutes;</hi> the unreasonable <hi>importunity,</hi> which is lookt upon as a piece of <hi>friendship</hi> and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous entertainment, (but indeed is not so) leads many into <hi>excess,</hi> that would otherwise forbear it. How often are persons enticed and persuaded to burden themselves with <hi>more than is meet,</hi> at the rich Man's Table! How are their Stated Meals inordinately <hi>lengthned out</hi> to this very purpose! And it may be, some of the best and most inviting Provisions <hi>kept till last,</hi> that when Men have <hi>sufficiently eaten,</hi> they may have a <hi>bait</hi> before them, not easie to be resisted! This is the <hi>Plague</hi> of Luxury, which the <hi>Master of the Pest-house</hi> does not strive to <hi>cure,</hi> but makes it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to <hi>propagate</hi> among his <hi>beastly compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How are <hi>worldly riches abused by</hi> these sins? In general, they are lavish'd out and perverted to <hi>other Ends,</hi> than which they are given for. Providence affords them in order to the doing of <hi>good,</hi> but Pride and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury turns them into instruments <hi>of evil,</hi> and the fewel of unlawful lust. This will appear more fully, if we consider these three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Riches are given to <hi>glorifie God</hi> with. We are to <hi>honour the Lord with our Substance,</hi> Prov. 3.9. but this is an abusing of them to his open <hi>dishonour</hi> and a laying of them out to serve and <hi>gratifie the Devil.</hi> It is an employing of the Creatures of God <hi>against</hi> him, and a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40872:9"/>
                  <hi>polluting of his Name</hi> with those very blessings which are as so many arguments and means to <hi>shew forth his praise.</hi> A plentiful Estate is an extraordinary <hi>Talent,</hi> which ought to be <hi>Traded with</hi> for the advancement of Christ's Interest in the World; but where these chargeable and <hi>expensive Vices</hi> prevail, this is not regarded. Men of this sort, express no concern for the Gospel; <hi>that</hi> may <hi>starve,</hi> while we <hi>glutted.</hi> Lust is insatiable, and snatches all; but that which <hi>cost them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> shall be <hi>offer'd</hi> to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Riches are given for the helping and <hi>relieving of our needy Brethren. Thou shalt open thy hand wide to thy poor brother, Deut.</hi> 15.11. As 'tis the Character of the <hi>vertuous Woman,</hi> that <hi>her Houshold are clothed with Scarlet;</hi> so she <hi>stretcheth out her hand to the poor, Prov.</hi> 31.20, 21. and indeed the <hi>grace of liberal distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution</hi> to the necessities of others, is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more blessed <hi>gift</hi> than any we can bestow, 2 Cor. 9.14, 15, But this Grace is banisht, and all the <hi>streams</hi> of Charity <hi>cut off,</hi> where the two sins in the <hi>Text</hi> are found predominant. Sodom's <hi>Pride and fulness of Bread</hi> was joined with this, that she <hi>strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not the hand of the poor and needy, Ezek.</hi> 16 43. while their own <hi>Eyes stand out with fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> they make no care to <hi>refresh the bowels</hi> of the miserable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Riches are given for a <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our selves,</hi> but the Proud and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious cross this end, and overthrow it, both as to <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul.</hi> 1. The rich man by his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40872:10"/>Luxury especially, <hi>sins against his own body.</hi> Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>for health,</hi> is a duty, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.34. and the <hi>cheapest diet,</hi> and the <hi>fewest Dishes,</hi> do (for the most part) serve this purpose best. The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of manifold <hi>distempers</hi> are laid in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary sins. Where <hi>famine</hi> at any time hath killed its <hi>hundreds, Excess</hi> hath slain its <hi>Thousands. Strength</hi> is impair'd, and <hi>Life</hi> shortned, by <hi>riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous living.</hi> 2. 'Tis a <hi>Sin against our own Soul.</hi> 'Tis true, that every sin is so, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.38. but this is so peculiarly. The <hi>heart is overcharged</hi> with it, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. the <hi>mind</hi> is stupified and besotted, and disabled for the due exercise of its <hi>reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculties;</hi> the <hi>Man</hi> is unfitted to perform the proper acts and operations of <hi>humane life;</hi> as <hi>Nabal became like a stone,</hi> even when the <hi>Wine was gone out of him,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.37. Men that will not be <hi>estranged from their lusts, quench the light</hi> of their understandings; by <hi>pampering</hi> the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they <hi>Feed a Bird which pecks out their eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whence is it, that <hi>worldly men</hi> are so <hi>incident</hi> to these sins? 3 Causes may be assigned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Natural Propension to <hi>flesh-pleasing.</hi> Carnal minds are delighted with <hi>carnal objects.</hi> Men that are under the influence of <hi>sence,</hi> as their governing Principle, and that walk by no other Rule, are easily carried away to acts of <hi>sensuality.</hi> Unmortified flesh is a most <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly evil,</hi> and (like <hi>Adonijah</hi>) it <hi>usurps the Kingdom,</hi> till Grace comes and dispossesses it; it will be provided for, and have its <hi>lusts ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,</hi> whatever is said the against it. Therefore 'tis observable, that the <hi>stubborn and rebellious Son,</hi> who <hi>would not obey his parents voice,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40872:10"/>as a <hi>Glutton and a Drunkard, Deut.</hi> 21.20. Reigning Carnality stifles the impression of all spiritual things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The concurrence of <hi>suitable temptations.</hi> As <hi>they that will be rich, fall into temptation and a snare,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. so they that <hi>are</hi> rich, have their temptations and snares also. Such as are superiour to others in Wealth and worldly Greatness, are tempted to <hi>lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> above them, to <hi>answer roughly,</hi> when the <hi>poor useth intreaties, Prov.</hi> 18.23. How inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently did <hi>Adonibezek</hi> treat his Royal Prisoners and Captives, when he had got the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent! <hi>Threescore and Ten Kings gathered their Meat under his Table,</hi> by his own confession, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1.7. This makes the caution so need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that the <hi>Rich Man should not glory in his riches, Jer.</hi> 9.23. Having the command of <hi>more than Heart could wish,</hi> they think they may dispose and use it as they please; they presume that they may <hi>do what they will with their own,</hi> and because they are not accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Men beneath them,</hi> they forget that they have received this trust from <hi>God above</hi> them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A slothful <hi>unactive life.</hi> Idleness is a sit <hi>Soil</hi> for such sins to <hi>grow</hi> and <hi>thrive</hi> in. If rich Men did but employ themselves, so as they <hi>might</hi> and <hi>should,</hi> in things truly worthy and becoming, the Devil and inbred Corruption would have much fewer advantages against them. <hi>Industry</hi> and Diligence would be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them in the avoiding of many a snare; but because they set themselves no <hi>better task,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40872:11"/>the <hi>works of the flesh,</hi> fill up their Lives. If they gave themselves to <hi>Reading, Meditation, Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. which they have great opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for, they would be less busied in the baser Drudgery of <hi>taking thought what they shall eat, and drink, and wherewith they shall be clothed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>ƲSE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information.</hi> In two things. 1. <hi>Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> and <hi>Oppression</hi> (it seems) are not the Rich Man's <hi>only crimes.</hi> These are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and frequent; but he that <hi>escapeth these,</hi> may nevertheless <hi>perish in his iniquity;</hi> I mean, in other iniquities which his condition of Life does peculiarly expose to. The <hi>way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> is but <hi>one;</hi> the <hi>road to Hell</hi> is brancht out into a <hi>multitude of paths,</hi> and he that <hi>treads in any of them,</hi> will infallibly go down thither. The foolish <hi>Prodigal,</hi> who <hi>throws away</hi> his Treasure, hath little ground to <hi>bless himself,</hi> that he is not as other Men, who <hi>hoard it up.</hi> 2. The <hi>abundance</hi> of this World, does rather <hi>increase</hi> than <hi>lessen the difficulties of Salvation, Matth.</hi> 19.23. Rich Men have those sins to be <hi>saved from,</hi> which their poorer Neighbours are not so liable to be <hi>infected with.</hi> Their <hi>Tables</hi> are more dangerous <hi>snares;</hi> and their <hi>Morsels,</hi> tho <hi>sweeter</hi> now, will be most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and are most usually, <hi>bitterer</hi> in the latter end. They <hi>pay very dear</hi> for these pleasant things, when the final <hi>reckoning</hi> comes. Tho Christ <hi>made his Grave with the rich in his death,</hi> 'tis <hi>comparatively rare,</hi> for them to find a <hi>place with him in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40872:11"/> 2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> In two things likewise. 1. Let them that <hi>have riches,</hi> be sure to <hi>watch against</hi> these Corruptions, and <hi>deny</hi> these Lusts. Forbear <hi>walking in so vain a shew;</hi> seek more to be <hi>arayed in that fine Linen,</hi> whereby the Holy Ghost sets forth <hi>the righteousness of Saints, Revel.</hi> 19.8. Consider the <hi>calamitous state</hi> of the Church of God at this day, with which the <hi>unseemly coverings</hi> of this day do not agree. When it went ill with the <hi>Jews, Esther</hi> sent <hi>raiment</hi> to clothe <hi>Mordecai</hi> with, and take away his <hi>Sackcloth</hi> from him, but he refus'd it, <hi>Esth.</hi> 4.4. Hearken a little to the <hi>complainings in our Streets,</hi> and do not contradict <hi>your own.</hi> Reflect upon the <hi>changes</hi> which have been made by Providence heretofore, <hi>Lament.</hi> 4, 5. Look forward upon the Judgments that threaten us, particularly that of <hi>National Poverty;</hi> which, where it comes, it terrible <hi>as an armed man.</hi> Or, if such a Scourge, by unexpected methods of Goodness should be kept off, yet remember what a <hi>different Dress</hi> you will put on, when you are to be <hi>laid in the dust;</hi> and how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it will be, for <hi>death</hi> to come with a <hi>mess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from God,</hi> and hurry your <hi>naked Soul</hi> before his Bar. Remember, that this <hi>body,</hi> which is now so <hi>delicately</hi> fed, is to be a <hi>feast for Worms,</hi> and that <hi>rottenness</hi> and corruption will soon <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> it. Yea, in <hi>Old Age,</hi> the <hi>sound of the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is low, Eccl.</hi> 12.4. and the <hi>tastes</hi> and <hi>relishes</hi> of food are lost, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.35. or <hi>sickness</hi> and weakness, before that comes, will make you <hi>abhor</hi> and <hi>loath</hi> the very <hi>dainties,</hi> which you are now so eager after, <hi>Job</hi> 33.20. <hi>Ps.</hi> 107.18.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40872:12"/>2. Let <hi>none of us</hi> be very desirous of <hi>entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> the Rich Man's <hi>temptations,</hi> by coveting his <hi>Lot.</hi> The circumstances of such persons (take them all together) are not really so much to be <hi>envied,</hi> as is commonly imagined. Things that feed corruption, and <hi>subject us to vanity,</hi> would not mightily encourage our choice of them, if we had a due zeal for the safety and welfare of our souls. <hi>Having food and raiment</hi> (tho of a meaner kind) <hi>let us be content</hi> and chearful, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. There are some <hi>favours</hi> which God forbears the dispersing of for our greater benefit, and the prevention of our <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</hi> As <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.3. <hi>I will not go up in the midst of thee, lest I consume thee in the way.</hi> So the <hi>plenty,</hi> which is afforded to some others, may be <hi>withheld</hi> from us in Mercy, that we may not be defiled and <hi>undone</hi> by it.</p>

               <p>THE Character of the <hi>Rich Man</hi> being dispatcht in the opening of the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Verse,</hi> I come now to the Account which is given of the <hi>Poor Man</hi> in these words, [<hi>And there was a certain Beggar,</hi> &amp;c.] In which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription we may take notice of these Five things. 1. His <hi>Title</hi> or Denomination; <hi>[nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lazarus.]</hi> We read of this as the <hi>proper</hi> Name to one that was our Lord's <hi>Friend,</hi> whom he would not recover from sickness, but raised from the Grave, <hi>John</hi> 11. But here we are to understand it as a <hi>common</hi> name given to indigent and <hi>needy persons,</hi> and the signification of it, which is, <hi>God help me,</hi> makes it very suitable to all such. 2. The <hi>Place</hi> which he usually possess'd; [<hi>who was laid at his</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40872:13"/>(<hi>i. e.</hi> the rich man's) <hi>Grace.</hi>] While the rich man himself was defended under his roof from the injuries and inconveniencies of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry season, fed to the full, and <hi>warm</hi> enough within, this poor Beggar was Miserably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed without, pincht with <hi>cold,</hi> as well as hunger, at the Door. 3. The ill state of his <hi>body: [full of Sores]</hi> like <hi>Job,</hi> sitting down among the <hi>ashes,</hi> when Satan by God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission had Smitten him with <hi>boils</hi> from Head to Foot, <hi>Job</hi> 2.7, 8. These were not <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> Ulcers, nor <hi>wilfully</hi> made, nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posey <hi>kept uncur'd,</hi> (as the Artifice of some wretched creatures is to move and stir up pity) but real <hi>painful</hi> Sores, which it pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to visit him with, and add to his affliction by. 4. The <hi>request</hi> which his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity put him upon: <hi>[and desiring to be fed with the crumbs wdich fell from the Rich man's Table.]</hi> His request was <hi>Modest,</hi> like that of the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who did not ask for <hi>Childrens Bread,</hi> but pleaded for <hi>Crumbs. Mat.</hi> 15.27. The very Refuse of the Rich Man's Food, which he might be willing to cast away, this <hi>Lazarus</hi> begs to have bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him. But we have no intimation here of the rich man's <hi>answering</hi> this request, or fulfilling this desire: the Beggar lay at the door, as the <hi>impotent man</hi> at the <hi>Pool,</hi> in Expectation, but it seems to be vain and fruitless; like the <hi>poor Prodigal,</hi> who would fain have filled his belly with the <hi>husks, but no man gave unto him, Luke</hi> 15.16. so here, he sought for crumbs, but by the silence of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40872:13"/>the Scripture, one might guess, that they were <hi>denied</hi> him; not only the <hi>Gates</hi> of the rich man's house, but his <hi>bowels</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion were <hi>shut up</hi> against him. 5. The <hi>kindness</hi> shewn to him by the <hi>Brutes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>[Moreover the dogs came, and licked his Sores.]</hi> They upbraided the rich man, and might have taught him by their own <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> more mercy and tenderness, than he practised; they did what they could to <hi>heal</hi> the Beggar, whom he would do nothing to <hi>keep alive.</hi> It is remarkable, that those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creatures, which have a <hi>devouring fierceness</hi> in their natures, and have discover'd it against God's enemies, have shewn a <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> to God's children. The Lord and said, that the <hi>dogs should eat Jezebel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.23. And this was accomplished so far, that when they went to <hi>bury her,</hi> they found no more of her, than the <hi>Scull,</hi> and <hi>feet,</hi> and <hi>palms of her hands,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.35. and yet <hi>this very Sort</hi> of creatures perform'd a kind office to the Beggar in the Text. So 'tis threatned, that the <hi>Ravens shall pick out the eyes</hi> of Disobedient Children; <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.17. but <hi>these</hi> were the <hi>Caterers</hi> that fed <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>brought bread and flesh</hi> to him twice a day, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.6. The <hi>Lions</hi> did no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hurt to <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Den,</hi> but immediately broke the bones of <hi>his Accusers</hi> assoon as he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and they succeeded in his place, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.23, 24.</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> What <hi>difference</hi> there is, between the poverty of God's <hi>favourites</hi> and other <hi>persons.</hi> In general, to the one it is an <hi>affliction,</hi> to the other a <hi>judgment;</hi> to one a <hi>Rod,</hi> to the other a <hi>Scorpion;</hi> to one an <hi>infirmity,</hi> to the other a <hi>plague;</hi> to one a <hi>tolerable infelicity,</hi> to the other a <hi>grievous curse.</hi> But more particularly, there is a <hi>distinction</hi> in the <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of each.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>causes</hi> from whence this Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proceeds, they are very different, the one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40872:14"/>from the other. 1. The Poverty of God's <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites</hi> is <hi>usually</hi> brought upon them by the <hi>meer hand of Providence:</hi> 'tis a <hi>temptation,</hi> which God <hi>leads them into:</hi> but the poverty of <hi>others,</hi> is for the <hi>most part,</hi> by their <hi>own procurement,</hi> and the <hi>natural,</hi> as well as <hi>paenal</hi> consequent of their own folly and sin. As to some, 'tis especially true, that <hi>the Lord maketh poor,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7. and they may be called, by way of appropriation, and in the most restrained sence, <hi>His poor, Psa.</hi> 74.19. for <hi>Gods poor</hi> are they, whom he places in such a condition from the <hi>first,</hi> or reduces to it <hi>asterwards;</hi> but there are also the <hi>Devils poor,</hi> who owe their poverty to him and themselves, suffering as <hi>Evil doers,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> for their own wickedness. Several <hi>sins</hi> might be mentioned, which commonly bring men into these Circumstances, which they that are belov'd of God, do <hi>in the main</hi> (at least) keep clear from, but which others are oftentimes <hi>predominantly</hi> guilty of. As (1.) <hi>Slothfulness.</hi> This is an Empoverishing sin, and <hi>Cloths</hi> many an one with <hi>Rags,</hi> which can not with comfort be reflected on, <hi>Iro.</hi> 20.4. <hi>the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold, therefore shall he beg in harvest and have nothing.</hi> When the prudent labours of honest Diligence in some <hi>lawful Calling</hi> are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially Defeated, 'tis perfectly another Case, and we may have Peace and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when it is so. God hath no where promised, that any shall be supported and maintain'd with the <hi>Bread of Idleness;</hi> but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40872:15"/>the Command extends to all, that <hi>with qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness they Work, and eat their own Bread,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.12. As if it were not strictly <hi>their own,</hi> unless <hi>earned</hi> by their own Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, when they are capable of it. 'Tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that <hi>Bread</hi> may not be always <hi>to the Wise,</hi> Eccl. 9.11. but the <hi>Fool, that foldeth his hands together,</hi> can look to be <hi>fed with</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>his own Flesh,</hi> c. 4.5. (2.) <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality.</hi> Multitudes are ruin'd and undone by their own <hi>Excesses.</hi> Other Sins may be like a <hi>secret Worm at the Root</hi> of flourishing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, which insensibly consumes them, but this is like a <hi>wild Beast</hi> which openly devours them. <hi>The Drunkard and the Glutton shall come to Poverty,</hi> Prov. 23.21. Thus he in the Parable <hi>wasted his Substance,</hi> Luke 15.13. They that have <hi>Bread enough and to spare,</hi> are brought many times to a <hi>Morsel of Dread</hi> by their intemperate Abuse; they <hi>live</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly <hi>in Pleasure</hi> for a while, till they have not left themselves wherewith to <hi>live at all.</hi> This puts a dreadful <hi>sting</hi> into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, when it comes; which is not to be prevented, but by Sobriety and <hi>Moderation</hi> in the management of what God gives us to possess and enjoy. (3.) The keeping of <hi>ill and useless Company. He that followeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vain Persons, shall have Poverty enough,</hi> Prov. 28.19. A <hi>mispence of Time</hi> among those whose Conversation is utterly unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, whom we can neither <hi>do</hi> any good to, nor <hi>receive</hi> any from, leads first to a <hi>neglect,</hi> and so to the <hi>Destruction,</hi> even of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40872:15"/>our secular Affairs. He that is a <hi>Companion of Fools,</hi> does generally smart for it in this World; but he that is <hi>wise to Salvation,</hi> will also learn this Wisdom, of avoiding all such Men, how charming soever they may be by a little <hi>empty Wit</hi> and <hi>Drollery.</hi> (4.) The coveting and pursuing of <hi>unrighteous Gains. Treasures of wickedness</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Treasures got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by such means) are like <hi>Treasures of Snow,</hi> which dissolve and <hi>melt away.</hi> Fraud and Violence tend to <hi>corrupt</hi> the Estates, which they help to <hi>generate;</hi> as <hi>Rust and Canker</hi> in the <hi>Mettals</hi> which are hastily heap'd up. No Riches so <hi>deceitful</hi> to those that have, and hope to hold them, as they that are <hi>deceitfully acquir'd;</hi> he that hath <hi>swallow'd them down,</hi> shall <hi>vomit them up</hi> again. As <hi>Eliphaz</hi> says of the <hi>Oppressor,</hi> that he <hi>wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth abroad for Bread, crying, where is it?</hi> Job 15.23. 2. The Poverty of God's <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites</hi> is <hi>oftentimes</hi> for the <hi>Gospel's sake;</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by their zealous and stedfast Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and Practice of <hi>Religion;</hi> but the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of <hi>others</hi> does <hi>seldom</hi> happen on any such account. <hi>Persecution</hi> impoverishes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Saint; they that have <hi>Houses and Lands,</hi> are very often driven to <hi>forsake</hi> them, if they will faithfully adhaere to Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29. Thus the Converted <hi>Hebrews took joyfully the spoiling of their Goods,</hi> Heb. 10.34. What they had, they were content to <hi>lose,</hi> in the assured Expectation of a rich and glorious Recompence hereafter. To be thus Poor, is to <hi>put out</hi> our Riches to the <hi>best
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40872:16"/>usury;</hi> the laying of them down in the cause of God, turns to infinitely more <hi>Advantage,</hi> than what we can make any other way. But <hi>few</hi> of the Children of this World will submit to this, when they can escape it; they have not <hi>Love</hi> enough to God and Religion, to <hi>bereave</hi> themselves of what they esteem so highly, for their sakes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Effects</hi> proceeding from this Poverty, they differ as much. 1. Poverty quickens the Friends of God to <hi>Repentance for former Sins,</hi> but it throws others into <hi>new Sins.</hi> As the Prodigial's <hi>coming to want,</hi> was that which made way for his <hi>coming to himself;</hi> so extream necessity hath been a <hi>sanctified means</hi> of bringing past evils to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent remembrance. A Child of God, when his Father appears as an <hi>Adversary</hi> against him, tho' but in his worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, will be apt to enquire, <hi>Why is it thus?</hi> But other Persons, instead of doing so, are ready to provoke God <hi>yet more,</hi> by fresh Crimes, and increased Guilt. <hi>Agur</hi> hath given an hint of what is too common in this Case, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Lest I be Poor and steal, did take the name of my God in vain.</hi> When any <hi>breaches</hi> are made upon their Estates, they frequently seek to repair them by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Methods and wicked Courses. 2. Poverty makes the Heirs of Heaven more <hi>earnestly sollicitous</hi> about the <hi>true Riches;</hi> but it puts worldly Men upon more <hi>furious Prosecutions</hi> of <hi>worldly Wealth:</hi> Being deprived of it, they are greedieer after it, and when God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40872:16"/>
                  <hi>throws down</hi> their <hi>Babels,</hi> they are mad to <hi>build</hi> them again. A temporal loss is a Spur to a Believer to look out after <hi>a better and more enduring Substance;</hi> but other Men, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding such rebukes, are for <hi>laying up Treasures on Earth,</hi> and <hi>pating after this Dust</hi> still. Poverty does not deter the Men of the Earth from their attempts and <hi>labours to be Rich;</hi> tho' the <hi>stream</hi> of Providence run ever so <hi>contrary</hi> to them, they are restless in their <hi>striving</hi> against it; but holy Souls will alter their course, and contend more for the <hi>good Part which cannot be taken from them;</hi> and if God <hi>out them short</hi> as to <hi>this</hi> World, it makes them provide with so much greater Care and Industry for the <hi>next.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How does it appear, that they who are exercis'd with Poverty, may <hi>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> be <hi>God's favourites?</hi> There are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous undeniable Evidences of it. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself, the Son of God's Love, <hi>honour'd</hi> this Condition by <hi>being in</hi> it. <hi>Tho' he was Rich, yet for our sakes, he became Poor,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. Tho' he was <hi>in the Bosom of the Father</hi> with respect to his <hi>Deity,</hi> yet in his incarnate State; with Reference to his <hi>Manhood,</hi> he had <hi>not where to lay his Head,</hi> Mat. 8.20. Tho' he were the <hi>Heir of all things,</hi> the Lord of both Worlds, <hi>The most High Possessor of Heaven and Earth,</hi> whose <hi>Riches</hi> are <hi>unsearchable</hi> and his Treasures inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible, who <hi>causes them that love him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40872:17"/>Substance,</hi> (Prov. 8.21.) yet in the Days of his Flesh, there were many <hi>that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred of their Substance to him,</hi> Luke 8.3. his Parents were Poor, his Virgin-Mother in a <hi>low Estate,</hi> Luke 1.48. and he <hi>humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> to be in the like Circumstances.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture represents such as the <hi>Objects</hi> of God's <hi>peculiar electing</hi> Love, <hi>James</hi> 2.5. <hi>Hath not God chosen the Poor of this World?</hi> Not them <hi>only,</hi> but them more <hi>usually</hi> than others of a superior Degree. As the Tribe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> who had <hi>no Inheritance</hi> among their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the <hi>Israelites,</hi> were <hi>brought nearest</hi> to God, and <hi>set apart</hi> for his Service; so they whom God hath design'd for the Enjoyment of himself, as their <hi>Portion for ever,</hi> are most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destitute of any considerable <hi>outward Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> here. He is so far from <hi>regarding the Rich more than the Poor,</hi> that if we examine the course of his Dealings, we shall find the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to be rather true. He chuses those, whom Men are most apt to reject; the <hi>Vessels of his Mercy</hi> are seldom <hi>finely painted,</hi> but made of <hi>homely Clay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath often singled out the <hi>meanest Persons,</hi> for the most <hi>honourable Employments.</hi> As in the <hi>natural Body,</hi> he hath <hi>given more abundant Honour to those parts which lacked,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.24. So in the <hi>mystical Body,</hi> he hath made the <hi>chiefest use</hi> of those <hi>Members,</hi> which have had the <hi>least of external Dignity.</hi> It was <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Objection against himself, but God overrul'd it. <hi>Wherewith shall I save Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael? behold my Family is poor in Manasseh, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40872:17"/>I am the least in my Father's House,</hi> Judg. 6.15. and therefore his success is set forth by a <hi>Gake of Barley Bread</hi> (not of <hi>costly Flower</hi>) overturning the Tents of <hi>Midian,</hi> c. 7.13. The <hi>Apostles,</hi> for poor <hi>Fishermen,</hi> were made <hi>Fishers of Men,</hi> and so the glorious Gospel was not only preached <hi>to the</hi> Poor, but <hi>by</hi> them. They that <hi>made many Rich,</hi> were <hi>Poor themselves,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Grace of Sanctification</hi> hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed most <hi>eminently,</hi> where the <hi>Gifts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> have been most <hi>sparingly. Blessed be your Poor</hi> (says Christ to his Disciples) <hi>for yours is the Kingdom of God,</hi> Luke 6.20. tho they had little without them, they had <hi>a Kingdom within</hi> them; they were empty of worldly things, but <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Fruits of Righteousness. So it was written to the Church in <hi>Smirna.</hi> Rev. 2.9. <hi>I know thy Works and Tribulation, and Poverty; but thou art Rich.</hi> There is a seeming <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> in the Words, but really a great <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> 'tis no strange thing for Persons to be Poor and Rich in <hi>divers respects</hi> at the same time; Poor as to the things which concern their temporal Condition, Rich as to the <hi>things which accompany Eternal Salvation.</hi> The Soul hath been <hi>nobly</hi> furnisht, when the Body hath been supplied <hi>as meanly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why are God's Favourites at any time so <hi>exercised,</hi> as to have <hi>Poverty</hi> for their Lot? <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">

Sometimes Providence is signalized in their <hi>future prosperity.</hi> After they have been in <hi>straits,</hi> they are strangely blest with <hi>fulness</hi> again. <hi>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the beggar from the dunghil, to set them among Princes,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8. Thus God dealt with <hi>Job</hi> (tho poor to a <hi>Proverb</hi>) <hi>turning his captivity, and giving him twice as much as he had before,</hi> Job 42.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To prove and excite the <hi>charity of the rich.</hi> On this account God told the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>poor should never cease out of their land, Deut.</hi> 15.11. and our Lord says, <hi>The poor you have always with you, John</hi> 12.8. In Heaven, <hi>this sort</hi> of charity <hi>will fail,</hi> for want of <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> but as long as the World stands, there will be a constant <hi>succession</hi> of objects, and (we may therefore fear) too often a want of <hi>charity it self.</hi> If God had <hi>equally</hi> distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the good things of this World, there
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40872:18"/>would have been no room nor <hi>opportunity</hi> for any such beneficence; so that the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God hath ordered an unequal distribution; to some it is <hi>redundant,</hi> and to others <hi>defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> that they who have <hi>more than they need,</hi> may give to those who have <hi>not enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To convince the World, that our <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> is not to be expected <hi>here;</hi> that our <hi>life consisteth not in abundance</hi> of earthly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. for then undoubtedly the Saints of God would be priviledged with such a <hi>measure</hi> of them, more than other men, because they are dearest unto God, and must needs be supposed to have the <hi>best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi> made for them. This Dispensation plainly teaches us, that the <hi>hopes</hi> of reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, cann't be in the present state, in which they who are the <hi>first fruits of God's creatures,</hi> whom he values most, are the <hi>most miserable,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. Is it likely (can any one think) that <hi>such,</hi> above all others, should <hi>hunger and thirst,</hi> be <hi>naked and destitute, wander about,</hi> and have <hi>no certain dwelling place,</hi> if the love of God were to be <hi>known</hi> by outward prosperity, or our blessedness <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended</hi> on it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. To render the <hi>Graces</hi> of believers the <hi>more illustrious,</hi> for the <hi>shaming</hi> of the Devil, and all their reproachful accusers. This was the very main design of God, in stripping of holy <hi>Job</hi> so bare as he did, and <hi>destroying him on every side;</hi> that <hi>Satan</hi> and his <hi>censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friends</hi> might be found <hi>liars,</hi> and that he might be a famous <hi>Example of suffering affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:40872:19"/>to following Ages. There are severall Graces which <hi>shine out</hi> very remarkably in such a season. As (1.) Their <hi>Faith</hi> is seen by trusting in God, when they have not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain riches</hi> to trust to; <hi>the poor committeth himself to thee, Psal.</hi> 10.14. (2.) Their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> in a submissive bearing of those <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> which throw others into raging dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. (3.) Their <hi>Humility;</hi> for 'tis the <hi>lowliness of their minds,</hi> which reconciles them to the <hi>lowness of their condition.</hi> (4.) Their <hi>deadness to the World;</hi> for it shews a mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frame, and an heavenly contempt of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, when we have attained, with <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>take pleasure in necessities,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>ƲSE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information.</hi> We may learn hence, That (1.) Poverty in it self, separated from <hi>guilt,</hi> is not really, any <hi>scandal</hi> or disgrace. There is no Infamy in living upon <hi>Alms,</hi> when Providence constrains to it. And therefore the <hi>Ʋnjust Steward</hi> spake the pride of his heart, <hi>v.</hi> 3. of this <hi>Chapter, I cannot dig, to beg I am ashamed.</hi> The despising of the <hi>poor,</hi> is indeed, a despising of <hi>God, Whoso mocketh the poor, reproacheth his maker, Prov.</hi> 17.5. the maker <hi>of the poor</hi> as well as <hi>his own maker, c.</hi> 22.2. No part of the <hi>workmanship of Providence</hi> is contemptible. (2.) <hi>Temporal Promises</hi> must not be understood <hi>too strictly.</hi> It is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.10. That <hi>they who seek the Lord shall not want any good thing;</hi> now, if
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40872:19"/>they either <hi>have</hi> what they might desire, or are <hi>satisfied without it,</hi> this is true. So <hi>David</hi> says, that <hi>he had not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread, Psal.</hi> 37.25. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>he himself</hi> beg'd his bread, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.3. and when hunted by <hi>Saul,</hi> was forced to spend a great deal of his time in a <hi>Genteeler kind</hi> of Beggery, (as one fitly calls it) but yet take his words all together, he was not <hi>forsaken</hi> all this while, nor did he <hi>seek his bread out of desolate places,</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 109.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. Let them that are of <hi>low degree,</hi> rejoice in their <hi>spiritual exaltation, James</hi> 1.9. 'Tis matter of Glory, when that which is defective in <hi>common blessings,</hi> is made up in the <hi>choicest favours.</hi> Besides, your <hi>frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are truly sweeter than other mens <hi>whole Dishes;</hi> there is more of the goodness of God to be <hi>tasted</hi> in your <hi>Water</hi> than in their <hi>Wine;</hi> and when you have least, you are suffered to <hi>lack nothing;</hi> as the <hi>Disciples</hi> acknowledged, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.35. Therefore you have sufficient ground of chearfulness and triumph.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let them that have any <hi>overflowings</hi> of this World, <hi>distribute to the necessities of Saints, Rom.</hi> 12.13. (1.) <hi>Distribute;</hi> This is <hi>making to your selves friends of the Mammon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness, v.</hi> 9. of this Chap. that while your own loins are <hi>warmed,</hi> other mens may <hi>bless</hi> you too, <hi>Job</hi> 31.20. (2.) Let it be <hi>to the necessitous;</hi> not where there is no need of <hi>receiving,</hi> but rather ability of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating.</hi> Remember <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.16. <hi>He
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40872:20"/>that giveth to the Rich,</hi> as well as he that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth the Poor, <hi>shall surely come to want.</hi> (3.) To <hi>Saints;</hi> no Objects so fit and <hi>deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> as they. Their <hi>acquiescence</hi> in their Condition is a <hi>Motive</hi> to your Liberality, not an <hi>Excuse</hi> for your withholding of it. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13, 14. <hi>Religious Poor,</hi> are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the least confident and <hi>clamorous,</hi> when their wants <hi>cry loudest,</hi> and therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the <hi>largest share</hi> in our freest boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

               <p>THE Three foregoing Verses have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht us with a Representation of the <hi>different States</hi> of the Rich and Poor Man <hi>in this World;</hi> we must now begin to consider how differently also they are dispos'd of, and dealt with <hi>in the World to</hi> come. And to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Crder</hi> in the Text, the <hi>Happiness</hi> of the Poor Man in the next Life is to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, before the <hi>Misery</hi> of the Rich; for the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God is to be taken notice of here, in taking away the Beggar <hi>first,</hi> from the Evils which he underwent, while the Life of the Rich Man was somewhat further <hi>prolong'd</hi> as a space and Season of Repentance, tho he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd it not to any such end. It is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for God to remove his afflicted Saints <hi>sooner</hi> out of the World, than prosperous Sinners; and we may very well interpret it as an act of <hi>Mercy</hi> to both; for this makes God more <hi>quick</hi> in snatching good Men out of their Sufferings, and more <hi>slow</hi> to out off bad Men in their wickedness. But in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40872:21"/>this <hi>part</hi> of the verse, which concerns <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> only (whom the present Discourse is to be confined to) there are two things which chiefly occurr; his Death, and his Translation. 1. His <hi>Death. [And it came to pass, that the Beggar dyed]</hi> this is a <hi>debt,</hi> which the Poor are as much in a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,</hi> and under a <hi>necessity,</hi> of <hi>paying</hi> as the Rich; how <hi>indigent</hi> soever they be, they are not <hi>insolvent</hi> in this Case, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not <hi>exempted,</hi> nor would such an Exemption be their <hi>Priviledge;</hi> they must be <hi>obedient unto Death,</hi> and 'tis their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, that they are so. It is not said, <hi>where</hi> the Beggar dyed, nor is it at all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial or significant; whether he dyed at the <hi>Rich Man's Gate,</hi> in the open Air, or any <hi>other Place.</hi> The <hi>issues of Death</hi> are the same, whatever these little <hi>circumstances</hi> of Dying be; to expire upon a <hi>soft and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bed,</hi> or upon the <hi>bare and naked Ground,</hi> doth neither <hi>promote</hi> nor <hi>hinder</hi> the Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Person. 2. His <hi>Translation,</hi> which is here ascribed to the <hi>whole Man,</hi> tho indeed it concerned only <hi>one part</hi> of him, <hi>viz.</hi> his Soul; for <hi>that</hi> was carried by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not his Body. The principal Part is stiled the <hi>Man;</hi> what <hi>Matthew</hi> calsl a Man's <hi>Soul, c.</hi> 16.26. that <hi>Luke</hi> calls <hi>himself, c.</hi> 9.25. What the Soul does or enjoyes, is mention'd as a <hi>personal</hi> act, or a <hi>personal</hi> Fruition. <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Soul was carried, and therefore <hi>he</hi> is said to be carried, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here are two things to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40872:21"/>be further open'd; the Instruments <hi>by</hi> which, and the place <hi>to</hi> which, he was Translated. 1. The <hi>Instruments</hi> by which he was Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated. <hi>[And was carried by the Angels]</hi> not by a <hi>single</hi> Angel, but by more than one; for they are <hi>all</hi> ministring Spirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. God is pleased in this Case (as well as in several others) to make use of the Ministry of his Holy Angels; so the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> is probably suppos'd to be by their Hands, and yet. 'tis said, that the <hi>Lord buried</hi> him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.6. In the service of the <hi>Temple</hi> under the Old Testament, we often read of the <hi>Porters</hi> and <hi>Singers</hi> together, tho the Offices were very distinct; here the blessed Angels perform <hi>both</hi> those Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of <hi>singing</hi> God's Praise in Heaven, and of <hi>carrying</hi> separated Souls to it. When our <hi>earthly Houses fail,</hi> 'tis their work to <hi>receive us to Everlasting Habitations.</hi> 2. The <hi>Place</hi> to which he was Translated [<hi>into</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's <hi>Bosom</hi>] the <hi>Papists</hi> give a strange account of this; they make it a <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> a place for those <hi>Saints</hi> that dyed <hi>before Christ's time,</hi> upon the very Edge and <hi>Border of Hell,</hi> where they were kept (as they would have us believe) till Christ <hi>open'd the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> by his Death. But we are not to follow such foolish <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi> Abraham's <hi>Bosom</hi> is the same with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,</hi> and the <hi>third Heaven,</hi> where they <hi>always behold the Face of God;</hi> and there are some probable Reasons of it's being so express't. It is set forth by a <hi>Bosom.</hi>

                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40872:23"/>1. Because that is a Place of <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>rest,</hi> and sois Heaven. 2. It notes <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Favour</hi> and Affection to those that <hi>lye in it;</hi> as Jesus Christ, a <hi>beloved Son,</hi> is said to be in the <hi>Fathers Bosom,</hi> John 1.18. So they that are in Heaven, are the <hi>Objects</hi> of the highest Love, and under the <hi>highest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises</hi> of it. 3. The happiness of Heaven is often described by a <hi>Feast;</hi> where they were wont to <hi>lean upon the Breast</hi> of him whom they sat next to; as <hi>John</hi> on the Bosom of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 13.23. and the like Allusion may be intended here. Again it is set forth more particularly by the Bosom <hi>of Abraham.</hi> 1. Because <hi>Abraham</hi> was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>hospitable</hi> Person, while on Earth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark't for <hi>entertaining Strangers;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the <hi>Father of them that do Believe,</hi> might be judg'd very ready to <hi>welcome</hi> his <hi>Children</hi> and followers in Heaven. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>New Testament</hi> Believers are <hi>Heirs of the same Salvation,</hi> and partakers of the same Glory with those under the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. Abraham</hi> that liv'd so many <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Years before,</hi> and this <hi>Lazarus</hi> of a much <hi>later Date,</hi> lodge together. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are counted to the Lord as <hi>Abraham's Seed;</hi> therefore <hi>many shall come from the East and West, and sit down with him in the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 8.11. It is noted by the Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> that <hi>Lazar,</hi> is the Contraction of <hi>Eleazar</hi> (or <hi>Eliezer</hi>) who was <hi>Abraham's Servant of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus</hi> a <hi>Gentile;</hi> not suffer'd to be his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40872:23"/>
                  <hi>Heir</hi> on Earth, but lying in his Bosom in Heaven. 4. To shew that all <hi>worldly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects</hi> and Distinctions are <hi>utterly abolish't</hi> and laid aside in the Life to come. God <hi>fills his House</hi> above with the <hi>Poor and Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> not only out of the <hi>Streets and Lanes,</hi> but from the <hi>High-ways and Hedges,</hi> Luke 14.21, 23. And these are <hi>mingled</hi> with the <hi>wealthiest Saints</hi> that ever were, and are <hi>advanc't</hi> in Glory <hi>as much</hi> as they. The greatest <hi>Prince</hi> and meanest <hi>Subject</hi> will be <hi>equal</hi> there. <hi>Rich Abraham</hi> does not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to embrace a <hi>needy Lazarus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That there is such a <hi>Place of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Blessedness</hi> design'd and reserv'd for <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Souls;</hi> for them in general, and the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Poor</hi> in Particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>present Severities</hi> of Providence which are often exercis'd towards the <hi>best</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40872:24"/>Men, are a certain Evidence of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Blessedness in another Life; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it fares so <hi>ill</hi> with them now, we may conclude that it shall be <hi>well</hi> with them hereafter. We are sure, that such troubles would not befal them here, if there were not an infinite <hi>recompence</hi> to bemade for them at last. Multitudes of Saints have so little ease or quiet in this World, that from thence we cannot but Argue, there is a <hi>Rest which remains</hi> for them in the next. <hi>To you who are troubled, rest with us,</hi> 2 Thess. 1.7. The Scripture mentions this, as the great support and comfort of Suffering Believers, that their <hi>sowing in Tears</hi> below, shall be rewarded with <hi>reaping in Joy</hi> above; that there is a <hi>Glory to be revealed,</hi> wherewith none of these Calamities are to be compared.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Anticipations</hi> and <hi>Fore-tasts</hi> of this Blessedness prove it to those for whom it is design'd. The <hi>Promise</hi> of it is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd</hi> to them <hi>in Part</hi> already, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be no Delusion. They have so much <hi>Experience,</hi> as to convince them, that their <hi>Hope</hi> will not <hi>make them asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> They have some present feeling of the <hi>Powers of the World of come;</hi> some sweet and satisfactory <hi>Beginnings</hi> of <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> They need not say, <hi>Who shall ascend for us into Heaven?</hi> For Heaven is <hi>brought down into their Hearts</hi> in a very comfortable Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. There is but a <hi>gradual</hi> Difference between their <hi>Joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40872:24"/>14.17. And the <hi>Joy of their Lord,</hi> Mat. 25.21. One is a <hi>Pledge</hi> and forerunner of the other; their Happiness in <hi>Possession,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures their Happiness in <hi>Expectation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Nature of the Soul</hi> it self, shews that it was <hi>made</hi> to live for ever. It is of such a <hi>spiritual Substance</hi> distinct from this <hi>meterial Body,</hi> as intimates its intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>survival</hi> of the Body, after 'tis separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it. There are not two things more different and distant in their Natures one from the other (except <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Creature</hi>) than the Soul and the Body, the <hi>Dust</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls them, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.7. and therefore the issues of Death are not <hi>alike</hi> to both; the <hi>Dust returns to the ground, the Spirit to God.</hi> While these two are united, the Soul per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms many Acts and Operations, without and <hi>dependance on</hi> the Body, without any <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssistance from it;</hi> and therefore who can think that this Soul should be <hi>destroyed with</hi> the Body? Or that it should have <hi>no Sphaere</hi> to Act or Operate in, when once the <hi>Flesh sees Corruption?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The utmost Persection</hi> of our Beings is not <hi>attainable in this Life;</hi> and so <hi>never</hi> will nor can be attained, unless there be a more blessed Life <hi>after</hi> this. That which is the great and Principal <hi>End</hi> of Man, is very far from being fully accomplish't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; we can neither <hi>glorfie</hi> God, nor <hi>enjoy</hi> him, but very imperfectly, while we are here; we cannot be <hi>satisfied with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40872:25"/>his Likeness,</hi> nor have his Image compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly restored, as long as we <hi>dwell in Flesh;</hi> we cannot rise up to the Pitch of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness which God hath fram'd and <hi>wrought us for;</hi> but must be lookt upon as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>made in vain,</hi> that have lost the End of our Creation, even (in some Degree) without our own Fault. This must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, if <hi>Eternal Life</hi> be not given to them that <hi>seek for Glory, Honour and Immortality,</hi> Rom. 2.7.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Main and <hi>Chief Distinction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the <hi>Brutes</hi> is taken away, if there be no state of Future Blessedness; the Man that hath Understanding, as well as he that <hi>understandeth not,</hi> is <hi>like the Beasts that perish.</hi> 'Tis upon this Supposition, that <hi>Solomon</hi> discourseth; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.18,—21. <hi>That Men might see, that they themselves are Beasts;</hi> for <hi>one thing befals them both; as the one dyeth, so dyeth the other; so that a Man hath no preheminence above a Beast; all go to one Place, all are of the Dust, and turn to Dust again.</hi> Only here is the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that <hi>the Spirit of a Man goeth upward, and the Spirit of a Beast goeth downward to the Earth.</hi> The <hi>Bodies</hi> of Men and Brutes at Death are resolv'd into the <hi>same Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> Man's Prerogative is the <hi>Everlasting Existence of his Soul</hi> in a separate State.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> must be accounted as the <hi>greatest Impostor</hi> that ever was, if there be not a Blessedness in hope beyond the Grave for Holy Souls. That which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40872:25"/>
                  <hi>Blasphemy</hi> to imagine concerning our Lord Christ, must be an undeniable <hi>Truth,</hi> if the Doctrine and Belief of a Life to come be indeed an <hi>Error.</hi> The Scripture says, that He is the <hi>faithful Witness,</hi> that there was <hi>no deceit nor guile found in his Mouth;</hi> but how <hi>contrary</hi> a Character must he deserve, if those expectations of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed State hereafter, which he so frequently encourag'd in his Followers, should be <hi>false</hi> and groundless? <hi>In my Father's House</hi> (says He) <hi>are many Mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; I go to prepare a Place for you,</hi> John 14.2. If these things be but mistaken Fancies, he did not deal <hi>sincerely</hi> with his Disciples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How does it appear, that Souls <hi>go instantly after Death</hi> to this Place of Blessedness? That there is but a <hi>step</hi> as it were, betwixt the Holy departing Soul, and Eternal Glory; and assoon as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of this evil World, we pass <hi>as speedily as possible,</hi> into the better World.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the <hi>Opinions</hi> contrar to this, are most <hi>absurd</hi> and irrational; which are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>three.</hi> 1. The <hi>Ambihilation</hi> of the Soul, upon the Death of the Body, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>new Creating</hi> of it again at the Resurrection, when the Body is reviv'd. This hath been the wild Conceit of some, for which there is not the least pretence or appearance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40872:26"/>is said to <hi>prove,</hi> 'tis needless to say any hing to <hi>Confute.</hi> 2. The <hi>sleeping</hi> of the Soul from the Time of our Death to the End of the World; which of the two, is a more ridiculous and foolish Notion than the other; that an <hi>active</hi> Spirit should be render'd <hi>insensible,</hi> and all it's Faculties <hi>bound up</hi> for so many Years and Ages. This is less likely then the reducing of it to meer <hi>nothing.</hi> 3. The Invention of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as a <hi>middle Place</hi> for Souls to call at by the way, where they are detained for a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or shorter time. This is <hi>built upon the Sand,</hi> as much as the other two; for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Souls are made <hi>meet</hi> for Heaven in the <hi>Moment</hi> of their leaving the Earth, are <hi>immediately capable</hi> of it, and require no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preparations or <hi>refingings</hi> for that End.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have various plain <hi>Testimonies</hi> to this Truth, throughout the Gospel; besides the <hi>close Connection</hi> in the Text between the beggar's <hi>dying,</hi> and his <hi>being carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Abraham's <hi>Bosom,</hi> which imports, that there was no <hi>interval</hi> betwixt these two things. So the Apostle speaks of being <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the Body, and present with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. No sooner absent from the <hi>one,</hi> but present with the <hi>other.</hi> So he says, that he had a <hi>desire to depart, and to be with Christ,</hi> Phil. 1.23. If Communion with Christ were to be <hi>interrupted</hi> from the hour of our departure to the Day of Judgment, it could not be <hi>desirable</hi> to a Believer; it would be rather better to <hi>abide in the Flesh</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:40872:26"/>still, if we were to be kept so long out of Heaven, after we are turn'd out of the Body. Even the <hi>Dead that dye in the Lord,</hi> could not be stiled <hi>Blessed,</hi> as they are, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. For Death, tho it put an End to all the Evils of this Life, would neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less be an heavy <hi>curse,</hi> by stripping them of all Opportunities both of <hi>Service</hi> to Christ, and <hi>Converse</hi> with him. But the most positive Text of all, is that Passage of our Lord to the <hi>Converted Thief</hi> upon the Cross; <hi>To Day shalt thou be with me in Praradise,</hi> Luke 23.43. There is no way of evading this Proof, but <hi>transposing</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma from the Word <hi>[Thee,] (verily I say unto thee,)</hi> and putting it after those Words <hi>[To Day],</hi> and so referring those Words, <hi>[To Day]</hi> to the Time of <hi>making</hi> the Promise, not of <hi>performing</hi> it. But this is so gross a wresting and abusing of the Text, that barely to <hi>mention</hi> it, is enough to <hi>overthrow</hi> it; for what will Scripture signifie, if such a Liberty be taken in the Reading and Interpreting of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What <hi>kind of Conveyance</hi> have the Souls of Believers at Death from the Holy Angels? <hi>Ans.</hi> In four Things; it is Free, and Safe, and Pleasant, and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a very <hi>Free</hi> Conveyance; a Work which the Angels are most ready to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in. They <hi>willingly</hi> undertake and go
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40872:27"/>about it, tho <hi>not of their own Mind,</hi> without Commission and Order from God. Tho' they do not <hi>run</hi> to fetch home this or that Soul, before they are <hi>sent,</hi> yet when they are sent, they <hi>fly</hi> with <hi>winged swiftness.</hi> They that <hi>rejoyce in our Conversion,</hi> Luke 15.10. Are glad tobe <hi>instrumental</hi> towards our <hi>Glorification.</hi> They do it not with Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but Chearfulness; 'tis not a <hi>burden</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon them; but at once an Act of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> to God, and also of <hi>Affection</hi> to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a very <hi>Safe</hi> Conveyance; there is no danger from the wicked <hi>Apostate Spirits,</hi> tho like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> they do <hi>pursue</hi> us, when we are <hi>going out of their Land.</hi> Satan is indeed the <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> Eph. 2.2. and we are to pass thro his <hi>Territories</hi> to the <hi>City of the Living God;</hi> but having such a <hi>Royal Guard</hi> of Angels to accompany us, we are most secure. For these Angels <hi>excel in Strength,</hi> Psalm 103.20. <hi>Are greater in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Might,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.11. Tho the <hi>Powers of Darkness</hi> be our Assailants, <hi>Angels of Light</hi> will be our Protectors, and do more <hi>for</hi> us, than they can do <hi>against</hi> us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is <hi>Pleasant.</hi> There would be Terror and <hi>Affrightment</hi> in conversing with Angels now, while we are <hi>compassed with Infirmity. Eliphaz</hi> says, that when <hi>a Spirit passed before his Face, his Hair stood up,</hi> Job 4.15. So when the Angel appeared at our Lord's <hi>Sepulcher, The Keepers shook for fear of him, and became as dead Men,</hi> Mat. 28.4. But when we come to be stript of our <hi>Body of Flesh</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40872:27"/>
                  <hi>of Sin,</hi> they will be very acceptable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful <hi>Companions.</hi> To <hi>see by Faith</hi> these <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi> Spirits <hi>hovering about</hi> our Death-beds, is a sweet Prospect, far beyond the most <hi>charming Objects of Sense,</hi> which we now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is <hi>Honourable.</hi> To be transported thus by Angels, is to be <hi>carried in Triumph,</hi> it is the putting of a <hi>Glory upon</hi> us, in our passage <hi>to Glory,</hi> to be waited upon by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>Superiour</hi> to our selves. This is the <hi>Father's good Pleasure,</hi> not only <hi>to give us a Kingdom,</hi> but to <hi>Conduct</hi> us into it by some of the <hi>Chief Officers</hi> and <hi>Principalities</hi> of it. The <hi>Children of God,</hi> are brought home, like the <hi>Children of a King,</hi> with <hi>Noble Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants;</hi> they have Company assign'd them, which are a <hi>Credit</hi> to them. Creatures which some have been tempted to <hi>Worship,</hi> are not only our <hi>Fellow-servants</hi> (as they own, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10.) but made to <hi>do Service to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Why does God <hi>Order</hi> it so, that Holy Souls should be convey'd to Heaven <hi>after this Manner? Ans.</hi> Here are several things fit to be consider'd. As.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When God <hi>drove Adam</hi> out of the <hi>Garden,</hi> he placed Angels <hi>at the Door of it,</hi> to hinder his return into it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. ult. <hi>There were Cherubims, and a flaming Sword to keep the way of the Tree of Life.</hi> It is therefore the more fit and <hi>Cougruous,</hi> that they should <hi>make amends</hi> for keeping us out
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40872:28"/>of an <hi>Earthly</hi> Paradise, by being the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to let us into the <hi>Heavenly;</hi> that they who were the Ministers of God's <hi>Justice</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Fall, should be made the Ministers of his <hi>Mercy</hi> at our Dissolution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. when <hi>Elijah</hi> was translated <hi>without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of Death,</hi> it was by the same Means; and therefore God makes use of them in the Translation of <hi>dying Sains</hi> likewise; to shew, that <hi>Death</hi> makes no differences in respect of our blessed <hi>Convoy. There appeared a Chariot of Fire, and Horses of Fire, when Elijah was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up,</hi> 2 Kings 2.11. as afterwards, when <hi>Elisha</hi> (his Successor) was beset by the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Troops at <hi>Dothan,</hi> the Place was full of Horses and Chariots of Fire round about him, <hi>c.</hi> 6.17. <hi>i. e.</hi> (as most do very reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably understand it) Angels assuming such <hi>Forms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Christs Ascension</hi> very probably, was not without the <hi>Company of Angels.</hi> We read of them not only at his <hi>coming into</hi> the World, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13. but at his <hi>going out,</hi> Acts 1.10. One of the Evangelist says, that he was <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up into Heaven,</hi> Luke 24.51. For tho he ascended by <hi>his own Power,</hi> and <hi>needed not</hi> the help of Angels to bear him thither, yet for the <hi>greater Solemnity</hi> of the Action, they were appointed to attend him. Hence <hi>David</hi> speaks of the <hi>Chariots of God,</hi> and of the <hi>Lord's being among them,</hi> upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, <hi>Psalm</hi> 68. 17, 18. Now, as our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension is <hi>by Vertue</hi> of his, it is <hi>conformable</hi> to it; as our <hi>forerunner</hi> went to Glory, so go we.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:40872:28"/> 4. Angels are <hi>sent forth to Minister</hi> to us while we <hi>live,</hi> and therefore are the sitter to perform this Ministry when we <hi>dye.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers being their Care and <hi>Charge</hi> now, 'tis not reasonable, that they should be <hi>negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> then, when their Assistance is especially necessary. Good Angels under God, are our present Defenders; <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psalm</hi> 34.7. Again, <hi>They shall keep thee in all thy Ways, and bear thee up in their Hands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psalm</hi> 91.11, 12. It would be strange, if they that accompany us <hi>all along,</hi> should forsake us in our <hi>last Moments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Angels will be employ'd to <hi>gather us together</hi> after Death, at the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> Mat. 24.31. And on that account they ar esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Reapers,</hi> c. 13.39. Tho Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self will raise and <hi>quickent</hi> our Dead Bodies, yet when they are raised, and quicken'd, it will be the Work of Angels to <hi>collect</hi> and bring us from the <hi>several Parts</hi> of the World into one great and <hi>general Assembly;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the more properly their Work also to carry our Souls before-hand unto Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We are to be made <hi>equal to Angels</hi> hereafter, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.36. and to be their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting <hi>Associates,</hi> Heb. 12.22. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what Messengers so fit to convey us to that Place which they <hi>themselves inhabit?</hi> We are design'd for the <hi>same</hi> glorious Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which they have <hi>stood</hi> from their first Creation; we are to live in their <hi>Communion,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:40872:29"/>and to <hi>unite</hi> in their Praises; consequently they are our most suitable <hi>Translators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>ƲSE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information,</hi> 1. This teaches us, that the Glory of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> is not eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the subserviency of <hi>second Causes.</hi> God is the grand <hi>Agent</hi> in our Preservation upon Earth, and Reception to Heaven; but An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are <hi>subordinate</hi> to him in both. We are <hi>carried</hi> by God supreamly, <hi>from the Womb to the Grave,</hi> Isa. 46.3, 4. But this does not exclude God's use of such Instruments as he thinks meet. He is to be most gratefully <hi>acknowledged,</hi> and yet they are not to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</hi> 2. Tho God <hi>hath a desire to the</hi> whole <hi>Work of his Hands,</hi> he manifests it <hi>soonest</hi> to our best and <hi>most valuable Part.</hi> He does not forget the Bodies of Believers, which are his Workmanship, but yet he leaves them to lye <hi>rotting in the Earth</hi> for a long time, before they are brought to <hi>dwell in Heaven;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Souls, which have the <hi>liveliest Prints</hi> of his <hi>Image,</hi> are immediately upon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving of our <hi>Clay-Tabernacles</hi> let into his Presence; as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Beloved Disciple</hi> was <hi>first</hi> admitted into the <hi>High-Priest's Palace,</hi> and afterwards <hi>he brought in</hi> Peter, <hi>John</hi> 18.15, 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. Let <hi>Sinners</hi> tremble to consider, <hi>whither they will be carried</hi> at Death; who are committed to no such <hi>Guardians as Lazarus</hi> in the Text, but on the contrary
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40872:29"/>are left to the rage of <hi>Infernal Spirits.</hi> Evil Angels, as the <hi>Executioners</hi> of Wrath, will convey the Souls of wicked Men out of their Bodies, before the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of God, and from thence to <hi>Prison.</hi> How much then does it concern you to look after a <hi>change of State,</hi> with greatest hast, lest Satan your <hi>Adversary</hi> should in a little time be authorized to come and fetch you away, and deliver you to the Judge! <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.25. 2. Let <hi>Saints</hi> rejoyce, both in the <hi>Expectation</hi> of Death, and when it <hi>comes.</hi> The Hope which they have, should make <hi>this</hi> matter of gladness to them, which to others is most dreadful. When old <hi>Jacob</hi> saw the <hi>Waggons</hi> which <hi>Joseph</hi> his Son had sent to <hi>carry him into</hi> Egypt, his <hi>Spirit revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> Gen. 45.27. So, tho our Journey to <hi>Canaan</hi> (in the <hi>last Stage</hi> of it) lye thro a <hi>gloomy Valley,</hi> yet we shall not be <hi>alone</hi> in it, nor will the passage be <hi>long;</hi> for we shall be <hi>born upon Angels wings,</hi> which move a great deal <hi>faster,</hi> than those Waggons. Let this therefore help to support us <hi>under</hi> our saddest Fears, and <hi>in</hi> our sharpest Agonies, that we are embolden'd to say with our <hi>last breath,</hi> as a dying <hi>Man of God</hi> once did, <hi>Angels do your Office.</hi>

               <p>HAving spoken to the <hi>Beggar's</hi> Death and Translation by the Hands of Angels into Heaven, in the <hi>former Part</hi> of this <hi>22d, ver.</hi> I come now to what is said concerning the <hi>Rich Man</hi> in these Words; where we have several Particulars offer'd to our Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. His <hi>Death; [The Rich Man also dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed];</hi> tho he <hi>outliv'd</hi> the Beggar, yet he <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd</hi> him in a little time; after a short <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive,</hi> he fell under the same <hi>Sentence,</hi> not being able with all the <hi>Substance of his House</hi> to defend himself against it. As 'tis said, <hi>Psalm</hi> 49.10. <hi>Likewise the Fool and the Bruitish Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son perish, and leave their Wealth to others.</hi> When their <hi>Souls are required,</hi> they have no more <hi>Power to retain</hi> them, than other Men 2. His <hi>Funeral; [And was Buried].</hi> There is no such thing mentioned concerning the Beggar, when he Dyed; not that we are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40872:30"/>therefore to conclude, that he had <hi>no Burial,</hi> but 'tis passed by in silence, because <hi>less honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The small and the great</hi> do both <hi>meet in the Dust,</hi> Job 3.19. They both <hi>go to their long home,</hi> but their <hi>Processions</hi> are not with equal <hi>Pomp;</hi> the Poor Man's Funerals are not so <hi>splendidly adorn'd,</hi> nor <hi>gallantly attended;</hi> he goes down to the <hi>Grave</hi> with less Noise and Observation. A <hi>decent Interrment</hi> is without doubt a due respect to the very <hi>ashes</hi> of the Dead; and therefore God threatens it as a Punishment to <hi>Jehojachin,</hi> that he should be Buried <hi>with the burial of</hi> an Ass, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 22.19. But the <hi>highest respect</hi> of this sort (even then beyond all the bounds and measures of <hi>Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>) which is exprest to the <hi>Dead Body,</hi> is of no Benefit or Kindness to the <hi>departed Soul;</hi> that in the mean time very often <hi>needs</hi> the greatest Compassion, but cannot receive it; The <hi>Mourners</hi> here <hi>walk about the Streets</hi> for a little while, when perhaps the Deceased is <hi>lain down in endless Sorrow.</hi> 3. The <hi>wretchedness</hi> of his Case in the next World; set forth by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>[in Hell]</hi> and <hi>[in Torments].</hi> (1.) <hi>In Hell.</hi> The original Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly signifie the <hi>state of the Dead</hi> in general, and sometimes the <hi>Grave,</hi> but here 'tis put for Hell, the <hi>state of the Damned,</hi> that woful <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which God hath allotted for the Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Residence</hi> of fallen Angels and wicked Men. (2.) <hi>Being in Torments;</hi> they that are in Hell, cannot be otherwise, but spend their Eternity without one <hi>Moment of Easte.</hi> They are <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to the Tormentors,</hi> Mat. 18.34.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40872:31"/>shall be deliver'd <hi>from</hi> them. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be endured upon Earth, which is to be matcht with the <hi>Pains of Hell;</hi> all the anguish and horror, vexation and disquiet, which any Souls have felt in this World, is <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,</hi> when compared with what they feel in that World, where can be no hope or possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Relief. 4. His <hi>Exercise of sight</hi> there; <hi>[He lift up his Eyes].</hi> Bodily <hi>Members</hi> and sensible Acts are ascrib'd in Scripture to <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Souls,</hi> only by way of <hi>Allusion,</hi> as they are likewise many times attributed to God himself, (tho he be a <hi>pure and perfect Spirit</hi>) after the manner of Men. The Apostle speaks of <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knee bowing at the Name of Jesus, of things in Heaven, as well as things in Earth, and under the Earth,</hi> Phil. 2.10. Which cannot be meant of such a <hi>bowing,</hi> as some superstitiously Practise, because the Things <hi>in Heaven,</hi> and <hi>under the Earth,</hi> have <hi>no Knees</hi> to bow in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Sense; but 'tis meant of an <hi>universal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> and Submission to the Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Christ. So here, the Rich Man in Hell had no <hi>Eyes of Flesh;</hi> but the <hi>Eye of his Mind,</hi> which had been <hi>shut,</hi> while he liv'd, began to be <hi>open'd</hi> after Death; his Understanding and Conscience were <hi>awaken'd,</hi> and he was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd</hi> of those things which he <hi>did not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,</hi> or <hi>would not believe</hi> before. 5. The <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of this Sight; [<hi>And seeth</hi> Abraham <hi>afar off,</hi> and Lazarus <hi>in his Bosom.</hi>] It would be very difficult to conceive, what <hi>Prospect</hi> the <hi>damned in Hell</hi> (who are compasst about with <hi>blackness of Darkness</hi>) could have of the <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40872:31"/>in Heaven,</hi> if this were to be understood of a <hi>carnal</hi> view; but the <hi>Perception</hi> of the Mind is very frequently in Scripture set forth by <hi>Seeing. I see</hi> (says <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>another Law in my Members,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>i. e.</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and Experience that there is such a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Corruption struggling within me. So here, the Rich Man <hi>saw Abraham and Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> i. e. he <hi>knew</hi> that they were together in a more Happy State than he was himself; he <hi>knew</hi> that the Beggar who had lain at his Gate in Extremity of Pain and Want, was now <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> got above all those Evils, and advanc't to a far better Condition, than he or any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son could be in, during their stay in this World.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To shew, that there is such a <hi>state of Misery</hi> for <hi>unholy Souls. Hell-Torments</hi> are no Melancholly <hi>Fancies,</hi> nor empty <hi>threatnings</hi> to keep the World in awe, but sad and dreadful <hi>Realities.</hi> For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>visible impunity</hi> of Multitudes of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in this World, is a plain Argument of <hi>Wrath treasured up</hi> against them in the next. It is this very Consideration which hath chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quieted and satisfied the Minds of good Men, with respect to wicked Men's Prosperity; that <hi>the Lord knoweth how to reserve the unjust</hi> to Future Punishment, when he exempts them from it at the present, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. They are <hi>not plagued like other Men</hi> now, <hi>Psalm</hi> 73.5. Because they are to suffer a great deal <hi>worse</hi> at last; the <hi>Rod of God is not upon them</hi> now, <hi>Job</hi> 21.9. Because it is to <hi>rest</hi> upon them for ever. <hi>Malefactors</hi> design'd for the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi> escape the lesser Penalties of <hi>Whipping,</hi> or <hi>Burning in the Hand;</hi> and their <hi>Execution</hi> is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>suspended</hi> to a longer time, when this kind of Penalties are more <hi>speedily inflicted</hi> for lighter Offences. So the greatest Criminals being often <hi>let alone</hi> in this Life, it shews, that there is a <hi>sorer Destruction</hi> appointed for them in the next.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The worst of <hi>Evils,</hi> which at any time are, or can be <hi>suffer'd here,</hi> fall vastly short of the <hi>due Demerit</hi> of Sin. 'Tis not <hi>possible</hi> for any Sinner to be so miserable within the bounds of this Life only, as he <hi>deserves</hi> to be on the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40872:32"/>account of Sin; for tho his Misery may be very great <hi>Intensively,</hi> yet as to <hi>Extension,</hi> it can be but small; how extraordinary soever it be as to the <hi>Degree,</hi> it must needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, as to the <hi>Continuance.</hi> Now it is necessary for the Honour for God's <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> that the Punishment should bear a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> to the Guilt; whereas there is no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between an <hi>infinite</hi> Transgression, and a <hi>finite</hi> Suffering. In every Sin committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, the Provocation is <hi>boundless,</hi> and therefore the Duration of the Punishment must be <hi>endless</hi> also. This is implyed in <hi>every dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience receiving d just recompence,</hi> Heb. 2.2. <hi>The Wages of Sin is</hi> (and cannot be but Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) <hi>Death;</hi> Rom. 6.23. Such a Wages as <hi>answers to the Work,</hi> cannot be paid in the compass of this Temporal Life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are few, if any, Sinners in the World, but what have some <hi>Intimations</hi> and <hi>presages in themselves</hi> of such a miserable State hereafter. What else is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calls a <hi>fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation?</hi> Heb. 10.27. These <hi>fears,</hi> which they would remove or extinguish, if they were able, are the <hi>earnest</hi> of what they must expect to <hi>feel;</hi> their <hi>Condemnation</hi> by their <hi>own Hearts</hi> at present, is like the <hi>first drops</hi> of that <hi>horrible Tempest</hi> which God hath threaten'd to <hi>Rain</hi> upon them. The <hi>Worm that never dyes,</hi> begins to <hi>bite</hi> them in this World; they are <hi>tormented before the time,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to put it beyond all Dispute, that when the Time comes, of their Passage into Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40872:33"/>their Torments will be <hi>abundantly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi> How can Sinners pretend to doubt (for their Doubts are meerly <hi>pretended</hi> for the most Part) whether there be such a Place, as an <hi>Everlasting Hell</hi> hereafter, when they carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them such an <hi>Initial Hell</hi> here?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Death</hi> hath really no <hi>Sting,</hi> and if it may be called an <hi>Enemy,</hi> is a very <hi>harmless</hi> one, if there be <hi>no Hell to follow</hi> after it. The <hi>Sting of Death</hi> is said to be <hi>Sin,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Sin <hi>binds over</hi> to a Punishment after Death. That which makes Death so formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Holy Ghost calls it the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> (Job 18.14.) is not the Dissolution of our <hi>present being</hi> so much, but as it is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to <hi>Future Misery.</hi> the value of that <hi>Life</hi> which Death <hi>puts an end</hi> to, is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily sunk by the continual Pressures and Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances which attend it, and taking them all together, they generally <hi>weigh down</hi> our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Delights so far, that we might be reasonably willing to quit <hi>both</hi> at once. 'Tis therefore the <hi>second</hi> Death which gives the main <hi>bitterness</hi> to the <hi>first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Glory</hi> of God's Justice could not <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever,</hi> if all the <hi>Monuments</hi> of it should be <hi>defaced,</hi> when this World comes to an end. Every Divine Attribute is to shine forth with an <hi>Eternal Lustre;</hi> and therefore the impenitent Sinner must <hi>suffer the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Eternal Fire.</hi> The <hi>Wrath of God</hi> which is now <hi>reveal'd from Heaven</hi> in the Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. is to be manifested <hi>without ceasing</hi> by its Effects in Hell. <hi>Moses</hi> cryes out, <hi>Who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40872:33"/>knoweth the Power of thine Anger?</hi> Psalm 90.11. If it were all spent and <hi>exhausted</hi> in this World, that Question might easily be answer'd. A <hi>Man's</hi> Wrath would then reach as far as <hi>God's;</hi> for Men can <hi>kill the Body,</hi> and torture it before they kill it; but when they have so done, they can <hi>do no more,</hi> all their Revenge is over; whereas the <hi>unknown</hi> Triumphs of Infinite Justice are <hi>perpetual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> came upon a very vain and <hi>needless Errand into the World,</hi> if there be no such thing as a State of Misery after Death. His Business (worthy of being undertaken by so great a Person) in coming from the <hi>highest Heavens,</hi> was to <hi>deliver Souls from the lowest Hell.</hi> Our Lord does not save us from the <hi>lesser</hi> Consequences of Sin, the Calamities of this Life, for we are still exposed to them, tho he be <hi>made Redemption</hi> to us; he <hi>sanctifies</hi> them indeed by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> but his <hi>Providence</hi> does not certainly <hi>defend</hi> us against them. Do we therefore enjoy no <hi>Immunity</hi> by the Death of Christ? Did he shed his Blood, and leave us as <hi>Obnoxious,</hi> as we were before? No sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>He hath deliver'd us from the Wrath to come;</hi> 1 Thess. 1.10. There is our Priviledge; but if that Wrath be <hi>Imaginary,</hi> so is our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That unholy Souls are <hi>actually</hi> in such a State of Misery, when the <hi>Bodies</hi> which Death hath parted them from, are <hi>lying in the Grave.</hi> As there is a <hi>Resurrection of</hi> (or to) <hi>Damnation,</hi> which concerns the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40872:34"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> 5.29. So there is a Damnation <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi> to the Resurrection, and that <hi>treads up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heels</hi> of Death, which respects the Soul. Now</p>
               <p n="1">1. This appears from the <hi>whole course</hi> and <hi>strain</hi> of this Parable. Christ does not speak of what the <hi>Soul</hi> endures, when it is <hi>reunited</hi> with the Body, but of what it undergoes, while the Body is Buried in the Dust, before it rises again at his second Coming. For 1. As the <hi>Beggar,</hi> when he dyed, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passed <hi>into</hi> Abraham's <hi>Bosom,</hi> so the <hi>Rich Man</hi> here is no sooner Dead, but we present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find him <hi>in Hell, and in Torments;</hi> as the <hi>Blessedness</hi> of the one was not <hi>deferred,</hi> nor put off, so neither the <hi>Misery</hi> of the other. 2. The <hi>Rich Man</hi> here must be supposed to be <hi>in Hell,</hi> while he had five <hi>Brethren living upon Earth,</hi> under the Ministry of the Word, and not yet <hi>come to this Place of</hi> Torment, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28, 29. Which could not be consistent with Truth, if the Rich Man's Torments here, were to be understood <hi>after the Resurrection,</hi> for <hi>then</hi> the state of all Persons and Things, will be universally alter'd and fixed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Judgment</hi> which passes upon every Person at the <hi>end of this Life,</hi> as well as there will be at the <hi>end of the World;</hi> when he dyes, as well as when he comes to be rais'd again; which is commonly distinguisht into a <hi>Particular</hi> and <hi>General</hi> Judgment, and there is the <hi>same event</hi> as to both. The Particular Judgment determines the <hi>Soul</hi> to that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40872:34"/>or Misery, which the General Judgment will determine <hi>Soul and Body</hi> to; that final Lot which will be cast upon the <hi>whole Person</hi> in the great Day of the Lord, will take hold of <hi>one part</hi> of us at our last Moments. The Scripture seems to hint these two <hi>several Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> of Judgment. <hi>We shall all stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ;</hi> i. e. all <hi>together,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our Joint-appearance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. And, <hi>Every one of us shall give account of himself to God;</hi> i. e. every one <hi>singly,</hi> and alone, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Time of Life</hi> is the Time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Forbearance;</hi> whereas if the Souls of the Wicked were not <hi>turned into Hell</hi> before the Day of Judgment, there would be a <hi>much greater</hi> Exercise of Patience towards them <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Death, than <hi>before</hi> it. The <hi>long suffering of God waits on the Disobedient,</hi> while living; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. But when Death comes, it gives way to provoked <hi>Fury.</hi> God bears with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>on this side</hi> the Grave; but not <hi>beyond</hi> it; he <hi>holds his Hand</hi> (it may be) as long as they are in this World, but upon their removal, he <hi>lets it loose;</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> takes place from thence forward for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next to the <hi>Frevention of Hell it self,</hi> it would be the most acceptable Doctrine to a Sinner, to think that he should be <hi>kept,</hi> not only while he lives, but while the World stands, <hi>from going thither.</hi> If the <hi>not executing of Judgment speedily</hi> in this Life be an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Sin, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.11. How much more would it be to have the Assurance of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40872:35"/>such a <hi>Suspension</hi> after Death? A little short <hi>respite</hi> makes Men <hi>Mad upon their Lusts;</hi> but how regardless would they be of all <hi>restraint,</hi> if Death and Damnation were so <hi>far asunder?</hi> It is the <hi>nearness</hi> of them one to another, which gives some <hi>check</hi> to the wickedness of Man upon the Earth, where otherwise would be none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How come the damned in Hell to have a <hi>Sense</hi> of those things there, which they had not here in this World? To <hi>lift up their Eyes</hi> then, which were always <hi>clos'd</hi> before? <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In Hell, the <hi>vail</hi> of Judicial <hi>Blindness</hi> is <hi>taken away</hi> (so far as it tended to their sinful <hi>Quiet</hi>) and the <hi>Spirit of deep Sleep</hi> goes off. Now they are given up to stupid Security, like <hi>Jonah in the Sides of the Ship;</hi> but they shall feel their Danger when they are irrecoverably in it, like a Man that is tumbled <hi>into the midst of the Sea.</hi> They are <hi>sear'd</hi> and harden'd now, so that <hi>things to come</hi> do not affect them, but when those things become <hi>present,</hi> Conscience revives, and (as <hi>Sampson</hi> with the <hi>Philistines upon him) shakes it self.</hi> God <hi>hides the Heart from Ʋnderstanding</hi> here, and that very justly after Men have <hi>hoodwinkt</hi> themselves, and so they go on to Hell <hi>Blindfold;</hi> but in Hell, they are immediately <hi>rows'd,</hi> Conviction <hi>seizes</hi> and <hi>fastens</hi> upon them. That <hi>Light</hi> which they withstood and <hi>kept out</hi> from promoting their Repentance, will <hi>break in</hi> to their Everlasting Confusion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:40872:35"/> 2. In Hell, there is a <hi>Cessation</hi> of all those <hi>diverting Charms,</hi> wherewith Men are pursued upon Earth. The <hi>sound of the Viol,</hi> the noises of wild and wanton <hi>Companions,</hi> the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive <hi>hurries</hi> from one carnal Pleasure to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, help very much to <hi>drown the Cryes</hi> of a Guilty Conscience here; the Soul hath so much to do in <hi>fulfilling the Desires of the Flesh,</hi> that it hath no leisure to <hi>attend</hi> to any other Matters. But all these things end with this Life; there are no <hi>Dalilahs</hi> in the next World to <hi>Lull</hi> Men <hi>on their Knees;</hi> no sensual <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments</hi> to <hi>bewitch</hi> them any more; no <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi> but the <hi>Voice of Roaring;</hi> no <hi>Wine,</hi> but that of the <hi>Wrath of God.</hi> The miserable Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner leaves all these alluring Vanities <hi>behind</hi> him, and hath only spectacles of Horror pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>with</hi> him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How is the <hi>Misery</hi> of the Damned <hi>aggravated</hi> by a Sence of the <hi>Blessedness</hi> of the Glorified? <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>One contrary</hi> in all Cases, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this, does set off, and heighten <hi>another.</hi> It makes <hi>Hell</hi> so much the worse, because there is such a place as <hi>Heaven. Outer Darkness</hi> is the more Dismal by reason of it's Opposition to an <hi>Inheritance in Light.</hi> It adds to a Man's Torment to be upon the <hi>Rack,</hi> when others are at perfect <hi>rest</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Bosom.</hi> A state of wretched <hi>Confinement</hi> is the less tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when there are such as live in the sweet Enjoyment of <hi>glorious Liberty.</hi> It is an
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40872:36"/>Aggravation of any <hi>Evil,</hi> to consider how great that <hi>good</hi> is, which it deprives us of, and excludes us from.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Envy,</hi> which is rais'd and sharpen'd by the <hi>Happiness of others,</hi> is a most uneasie, <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing Passion.</hi> Tho <hi>Wrath be cruel, and Anger outragious,</hi> yet <hi>Envy</hi> exceeds them; the Wise Man says, <hi>Who is able to stand before it?</hi> Prov. 27.4. So I may say, who is able to <hi>subsist</hi> with any Degree of Comfort <hi>under it?</hi> It breeds an <hi>Hell within</hi> us of it self, and it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed one great part of the Misery of Men's <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Hell.</hi> Our Lord describes it so; <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28. <hi>There shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth, when you shall see</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your selves thrust out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This Envy will be <hi>increas't</hi> by the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Persons, who are the <hi>Objects</hi> of it. These <hi>blessed ones</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, were formerly during their abode on Earth, of all Men the <hi>most despised;</hi> they were <hi>made a Gazing-stock</hi> (many of them) both by <hi>Reproaches</hi> and other <hi>Afflictions,</hi> Heb. 10.33. <hi>A scorn and a derision to those that were round</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, <hi>Psalm</hi> 44.13. Now that <hi>these</hi> Men should be <hi>advanc't</hi> to so much Glory, must needs be very cutting to those that have vilified and <hi>set them at nought;</hi> they can never bear that such as they, counted the <hi>filth of the World,</hi> should be number'd among God's <hi>brightest Jewels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It will aggravate the Sinner's Misery, that the <hi>same Blessedness</hi> which Saints now
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40872:36"/>possess, was once <hi>offer'd</hi> to him, but <hi>rejected</hi> by him. Time was, when the <hi>Door stood o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,</hi> and they would not <hi>enter,</hi> so that they may thank themselves for being <hi>shut out.</hi> If they had not <hi>neglected this great Salvation,</hi> they had been <hi>partakers</hi> of it also. The Proposals of <hi>Grace and Life</hi> were made to them, as well as others. to the <hi>Rich Man</hi> here, as well as to the <hi>Beggar;</hi> but the Beggar <hi>accepted</hi> what the Rich Man <hi>refus'd;</hi> and while the one was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his <hi>Choice,</hi> the other therefore might the more bitterly bewail his <hi>Folly.</hi>

As stubborn as Men are now in their <hi>resisting of the Truth,</hi> and bidding Defiance to all the Reason and Evidence which is laid before them, yet let them know, that these <hi>Atheistical Triumphs</hi> are but <hi>short,</hi> for there is not <hi>one unconvinced Sinner</hi> in Hell. As the <hi>Devils believe,</hi> so do all that share in the same Punishment with them. All such Persons may read both their <hi>Temper</hi> and their <hi>Doom</hi> in that Text, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.11. <hi>Lord, when thy Hand is lifted up, they will not see; but they shall see,</hi> &amp;c. They <hi>will not</hi> as long as they can avoid it, but they <hi>shall,</hi> when they can avoid it no longer. 2. If <hi>Heaven</hi> needed any thing to <hi>recommend</hi> it, or render it <hi>more desirable</hi> than it is, it would be so by the <hi>Sense</hi> which the <hi>Glorified</hi> have of the <hi>Misery of the Damned.</hi> This is reasonable to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40872:37"/>conclude from that <hi>apprehension</hi> which the <hi>Damned</hi> have of the <hi>Happiness of the Glorified.</hi> The Saints above are not <hi>ignorant</hi> of what they have <hi>escap't,</hi> and are redeem'd from; tho as to their <hi>particular Knowledge</hi> of those that <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> what they escape, I should be Cautious of arguing too far from <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.10. where we read of Antichristians being <hi>tormented in the Presence of the Holy Angels.</hi> This is certain, that <hi>Hell</hi> is so far <hi>naked before them</hi> in Heaven, as to make them eminently grateful for their <hi>own Deliverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. Let all Persons be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to <hi>know</hi> that <hi>for their good</hi> now, which otherwise they will know to their <hi>fruitless Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> when it is too late. He who turneth in to the <hi>Strange-woman,</hi> is said <hi>not to know that the Dead are there, and that her Guests are in the Depths of Hell,</hi> Prov. 9.18. But the time is hastening, when he shall be made to know it by woful <hi>Experience.</hi> It is in this Case, as it was with those <hi>Benjamites,</hi> who <hi>knew not that Evil was near them;</hi> Judg. 20.34. But quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after <hi>saw that Evil was come upon them,</hi> v. 41. Our Wisdom lies in the Exercise of <hi>preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Knowledge;</hi> keeping our <hi>Eyes so open</hi> now, that we may never <hi>lift them up in Hell.</hi> 2. Let us learn to <hi>stand in awe</hi> of that God, who is able to <hi>shew his Wrath,</hi> and <hi>make his Power known</hi> by such terrible Effects. 'Tis a Lesson which Christ teaches us; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear him, who is able to destroy both Soul and Body in Hell; first</hi> the Soul, and <hi>afterwards</hi> the Body. The meer <hi>fear of Wrath</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40872:37"/>too <hi>slavish</hi> a Principle for <hi>Children</hi> to be acted by; but yet it becomes even a Child of God to <hi>tremble</hi> at the thoughts of what <hi>his Father</hi> will inflict on the <hi>Devil's Slaves,</hi> while he rejoyces in being <hi>begotten</hi> to <hi>better Hopes.</hi> We are to <hi>save</hi> Men <hi>with fear,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than let them perish by <hi>foolish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence;</hi> for they that dare to Sin <hi>in the Face of such Destruction,</hi> can have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse or <hi>Cloak for their Sin.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>Rich Man</hi> being (like <hi>Judas</hi>) <hi>gone to his own Place,</hi> as hath been shewn, these Words begin the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> which is continued to the end of the Chapter, between <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Abraham;</hi> which we are by no means to understand, as if there were, or could be, any such <hi>Conferences</hi> held between the <hi>glorified</hi> and <hi>damned;</hi> for the <hi>Rich Man saw</hi> Abraham <hi>afar off,</hi> v. 23. <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> are at too great a <hi>Distance,</hi> to admit of <hi>mutual Conversation</hi> betwixt their several <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants;</hi> but the scope of the whole is to shew, what <hi>might be probably</hi> urged by the <hi>one,</hi> and what <hi>might as reasonably</hi> be replied by the <hi>other.</hi> In this Verse particularly, we find the <hi>Rich Man</hi> turn'd <hi>Beggar: Lazarus had been</hi> so on Earth, and now he <hi>is</hi> so in Hell. <hi>And he cryed, and said,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:40872:38"/>
               <p> Where we have these three things; the <hi>Person</hi> whom he addresses to, the <hi>Petition</hi> it self, with the <hi>Ground</hi> and Reason of it. 1. The <hi>Person</hi> whom he addresses to; <hi>[Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham]</hi> He calls him by that Title, not only out of respect to him, as an <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> Person, but as the <hi>real Father</hi> of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Nation:</hi> And that People to whom this Parable was spoken, <hi>boasted</hi> much in it, and laid a great deal of stress upon it, that they <hi>had</hi> Abraham <hi>to be their Father,</hi> Mat. 3.9. <hi>John</hi> 8.39. They Thought that the <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of being descended from him, gave them a <hi>rightful claim</hi> to all manner of Blessings; and therefore the <hi>Rich Man</hi> here is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced speaking <hi>in their Language,</hi> to Preface the following Words with more Advantage. 2. The <hi>Petition</hi> it self, which is set down both more generally, and more expresly. (1.) More <hi>Generally; [Have Mercy on me].</hi> One may very well think that the <hi>Papists</hi> are put very hard to it, when they would draw in this Text to countenance the Doctrine and Practice of <hi>Praying to departed Saints;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Supplicant</hi> here, was not a <hi>living Man,</hi> but a <hi>damned Soul</hi> in Hell; and the <hi>Issue</hi> of the Petition was discouraging enough; he urged it to no purpose, as the issue of all Prayers to Saints will be; he was disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to what he desir'd, and met with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. Saints <hi>can have no</hi> Mercy, where God <hi>hath none;</hi> 'tis in vain to invoke <hi>their</hi> Bowels, when <hi>his</hi> are shut up. They that have forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Fountain</hi> of Compassion, can have no
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40872:39"/>Benefit by going to <hi>Cisterns.</hi> (2.) More <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly</hi> and distinctly; and so his request may be divided into three Parts. 1. <hi>[Send La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus];</hi> 'tis no strange thing for the <hi>proudest Sinners</hi> to be sometimes glad of the help of the <hi>meanest Saints;</hi> to seek to be <hi>beholden</hi> to those very Persons to whom they themselves have been most <hi>barbarous;</hi> as the <hi>Rich Man</hi> here intreats relief by that <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom he when on Earth would not relieve. The Time may come, when the great ones of the World will not only earnestly covet the <hi>Mercies</hi> which they now contemn, but be willing also to employ the <hi>Instruments</hi> which now they are most apt to sleight. 2. <hi>[That he may dip the Tip of his Finger in Water]</hi> the three hundred Men of whom <hi>Gideon's</hi> Army was compos'd by God's Direction, were such as <hi>lapped the Water,</hi> by taking a little in the Palms of their Hands, and so putting it to their Mouths, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.6. But this dipping of the end of the Finger in Water, is a great deal less. It is a <hi>small Favour</hi> which is askt, and yet not <hi>so small,</hi> but that it is refus'd; how <hi>little</hi> soever those miserable Souls do crave, there is <hi>nothing</hi> which will be granted. 3. <hi>[And cool my Tongue]</hi> separate Souls have really no <hi>Tongues,</hi> any more than <hi>Eyes;</hi> but there may be an Allusion to the Anguish of <hi>this Part,</hi> because the Tongue is a <hi>Member</hi> whose <hi>sinful Abuse</hi> is particularly punisht in the next World; for the Holy Ghost says, that the <hi>Tongue is a Fire, and set on Fire of Hell,</hi> James 3.6. Therefore 'tis very just,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40872:39"/>that it should be reveng'd with <hi>Fire in Hell</hi> also. That Tongue which is so often inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately <hi>heated</hi> now, will need as much to be <hi>cool'd</hi> hereafter. 3. The <hi>Ground</hi> and Reason of this Petition; <hi>[For I am tormented in this Flame]</hi> He is said to be <hi>in Torments, v.</hi> 23. Here the <hi>Cause</hi> of the Torment is set forth. This, and such like Passages in Scripture, have given the occasion of the Dispute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hell-fire be <hi>Material</hi> or <hi>Metaphorical;</hi> whether it be properly and strictly <hi>Fire,</hi> such as we see or feel in this World, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the most <hi>exquisite Torture</hi> represented to us by that Figure. The latter is most likely, if we consider, (1.) That a <hi>Material</hi> Fire cannot feed upon <hi>Spirits;</hi> however the Body might be <hi>fewel</hi> for a devouring Flame; the Soul is no <hi>combustible Substance.</hi> (2.) The Fire which the Damned are sentenc'd to, is the same with that which is <hi>prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels,</hi> of whom real Fire can take no hold, and upon whom it hath no Power, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. (3.) <hi>Temporal Calamities</hi> in this World are often set forth by the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of Fire,</hi> Psalm 66.12. Isa. 43.2. and many other Places. (4.) The <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> and <hi>Guilt of Sin</hi> are frequently compar'd to Fire, when it cannot be understood of Fire in a <hi>literal Sense,</hi> Psalm 79.5. James 5.3. (5.) This Metaphor, when applied to <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Punishments,</hi> is often <hi>varied,</hi> which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates a <hi>figurative Meaning.</hi> Sometimes Hell is stiled a <hi>Furnace of Fire,</hi> Mat. 13.50. and at other Times a <hi>Luke of Fire,</hi> Rev. 20.14, 15.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40872:40"/>Now a <hi>Furnace</hi> and a <hi>Lake</hi> are so very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that Hell cannot be <hi>both,</hi> if we take those Phrases according to the <hi>Letter.</hi> (6.) The Representation of the Torments of Hell by Fire, does not only refer to Fire in general, as <hi>a raging furious Element,</hi> but it seems to have a particular respect to that Fire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Idolatrous Israelites</hi> offer'd up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>Moloch.</hi> This is the <hi>Tophet,</hi> which the Prophet says, was <hi>ordain'd of Old;</hi> Isa. 30. <hi>ult.</hi> And the place where this Cruelty was exercis'd, was the <hi>Valley of Hinnom</hi> (near to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>); and therefore <hi>Hell-fire,</hi> Mat. 5.22. is in the Greek, <hi>the Fire of</hi> Gehenna, or the <hi>Fire of the Valley of</hi> Hinnom. Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Souls</hi> will be sacrific'd to <hi>Infinite Justice,</hi> as those Poor <hi>Infants</hi> were there to a <hi>sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Idol.</hi> So that the Holy Ghost makes use of the <hi>similitude</hi> of Fire in this dismal Case, because the <hi>thing it self</hi> was made use of by the <hi>Jews</hi> on that inhumane Occasion.</p>

               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40872:40"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To shew, what those <hi>Refreshments</hi> are, which the Damned in Hell desire. So far as the <hi>Light of Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Nature of the thing</hi> will help us to judge of a State, which we are utter Strangers to, we may with good Reason conclude, that whatsoever would Minister any <hi>relief</hi> to them, is earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisht for by them. Particularly</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Recovery,</hi> if it might be, of their <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Enjoyments.</hi> It may be truly said of them in Hell, as it is of <hi>Babylon</hi> upon her fall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.14. That <hi>all things the which their Souls lusted after, are departed from them;</hi> but the <hi>Lust</hi> after such things does still <hi>remain.</hi> Their worldly carnal <hi>Inclinations and Appetites</hi> are not destroy'd, tho the <hi>Objects</hi> of them are taken away. The Miseries of the Damned do not make such an happy Alteration, as to render any of them <hi>more spiritually Minded</hi> than they were on Earth. They <hi>savour'd the things of the Flesh</hi> before, and so they do still; they were <hi>Lovers of Pleasures more than Lovers of God</hi> before, and so they continue still. The <hi>Principles</hi> of Sensuality stick to them, as much as ever, tho they are debarr'd from the <hi>Acts.</hi> It is part of their Sorrow, that they have <hi>left</hi> all their Delights behind them; for if they could command them <hi>now,</hi> as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as once they did, <hi>Hell</hi> would be better to them, than <hi>Heaven.</hi> Tho they enjoy'd <hi>too much</hi> of these things, while they liv'd, yet even after Death they say not, that they <hi>had
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40872:41"/>enough;</hi> they would be glad to <hi>return</hi> to them again; they would look out for no other Happiness, than what lyes in the <hi>same Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> if God would allow this to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Support</hi> under their <hi>present Misery.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Misery which they never <hi>felt</hi> before, they do certainly desire such support, as they never had before. <hi>Ordinary Infirmities</hi> in this World they were able to <hi>sustain;</hi> but the Torments of Hell do so vastly <hi>exceed,</hi> that they cannot <hi>bear up.</hi> As no Humane <hi>Power</hi> can <hi>resist</hi> the Indignation of God, so no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Patience</hi> can <hi>endure</hi> it; <hi>The great Day of his Wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?</hi> cry they, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.17. And yet that was but a <hi>lesser Day</hi> of Vengeance here on Earth: Damned Souls have a <hi>load</hi> upon them, which <hi>Mountains of Lead</hi> are nothing in Comparison of; and yet if we could sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any <hi>gracious Influence</hi> or <hi>Vertue</hi> going forth from God to them, how strangely would they be <hi>upheld?</hi> God Promises to <hi>make</hi> the good Man's <hi>Bed in his Sickness;</hi> and if he should do the like for those that <hi>make their Beds in Hell,</hi> how much more <hi>easie</hi> would they be, than they are? One <hi>Smile</hi> from God, the least <hi>Glimpse</hi> of any Favour, would wonderfully <hi>revive</hi> them in that <hi>Congregation of the Dead.</hi> Now tho the Damned bear no <hi>Love to God</hi> themselves, yet they must needs desire Manifestations of <hi>Kindness from him</hi> for their own Relief; What would they not give to hear the least <hi>sounding of his Bowels,</hi> while they are struggling with his Displeasure?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:40872:41"/> 3. An <hi>abatement</hi> of their <hi>Misery it self;</hi> a <hi>lightening</hi> of their Burden is very desirable, when there is no <hi>Strength</hi> to undergo it. Tho God do not <hi>quite take off</hi> his Hand from a miserable Creature, yet he can make a great difference in the <hi>measure of laying it on;</hi> some complain that God's <hi>Hand presseth them sore,</hi> Psalm 38.2. When others in Comparison are but <hi>gently toucht</hi> with it. Now the Hand of God lyes <hi>very heavy</hi> upon all that are in Hell; and therefore if God would but <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> their Sufferings, it would be a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Refreshment. Here, if God do <hi>visit in Anger,</hi> yet <hi>we know it not in great Extremity,</hi> Job 35.15. But in Hell, he <hi>makes a way to his Anger,</hi> he <hi>stirs up all his Wrath,</hi> so that a forbearance of some <hi>Degrees</hi> of Punishment would gratifie them in <hi>some part</hi> of their Wishes. The Scripture speaks of <hi>Judgment without Mercy,</hi> James 2.13. Such Judgment is scarcely executed any where, but among the Damned, and there it is; the <hi>Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of God may be said to <hi>fail</hi> there; he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes Sin there, <hi>as</hi> it deserves; the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which he hath now <hi>in store,</hi> will then be all <hi>brought forth;</hi> and therefore in such a Case, the <hi>Suppression</hi> of any of it is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be desir'd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Intermission in Suffering,</hi> tho but for a <hi>few Moments,</hi> now and then, would be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Advantage in a miserable <hi>Eternity.</hi> That which makes their Torments the worse, is the <hi>Constancy</hi> of them, as well as the <hi>length;</hi> they are <hi>continual,</hi> as well as <hi>endless.</hi> 'Tis the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40872:42"/>
                  <hi>Accent</hi> of Misery, to be visited <hi>every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> so <hi>David</hi> cryes out, <hi>Psalm</hi> 32.4. <hi>Day and Night thy Hand was heavy upon me;</hi> all Seasons were alike to him, and fill'd up with equal Distress. So <hi>Job</hi> expostulates with God, <hi>c.</hi> 7.19. <hi>How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone, till I swallow down my Spittle?</hi> It was a small <hi>Relaxation</hi> of his Troubles which he sought for, and yet he could not procure it. So it is, and much worse with damned Souls; the Anger of God is <hi>drawn out</hi> against them in one <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Line</hi> throughout numberless Ages; the Justice of God makes no <hi>stops</hi> nor <hi>Pauses</hi> in the inflicting of their Torments upon them, but is <hi>always going on.</hi> How comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table therefore would it be to them, to be allow'd the least <hi>breathing Time,</hi> the shortest <hi>interval</hi> between one <hi>Pang</hi> and another? Whereas in Hell, it is not so much a <hi>Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Misery, as <hi>one Instant</hi> of it without Succession.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A power of <hi>taking off their own Thoughts</hi> from the Torments which they endure. If they were able to do this, the <hi>enduring</hi> of those Torments would be far <hi>less grievous:</hi> If they could <hi>separate</hi> their <hi>Minds</hi> from their Troubles, they might make them <hi>tolerable;</hi> but when our Troubles do fully <hi>possess</hi> our Minds, and <hi>take up</hi> all our Faculties (which is their Case) it must of necessity be very doleful. The Soul in Hell is the very <hi>Seat</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of their Suffering; and therefore 'tis impossible that they should <hi>forget their Misery,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:40872:42"/>or put it out of their View. As <hi>David</hi> said of his Sin, they may say of their Sorrow, that 'tis <hi>ever before them,</hi> Psalm 51.3. It must be always <hi>present</hi> to their Understandings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Understanding is one of the <hi>Parts affected;</hi> the <hi>smoke of their Torment</hi> is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually <hi>flying in their Eyes,</hi> and <hi>beating back in their Faces,</hi> as fast as it <hi>issues forth.</hi> What a Refreshment would it be, if they could but retire and <hi>withdraw</hi> a little <hi>from themselves!</hi> If they could but <hi>benum their spiritual Senses</hi> for a while, and lay their <hi>Souls asleep</hi> in that <hi>Bed of Fire!</hi> Surely if Desires could purchase <hi>such</hi> a Liberty, every one would have it, as one of the best Remedies for that deplorable Condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whence do these <hi>Desires</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment spring in damned Souls?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Desire</hi> will <hi>move</hi> and work of it self in a <hi>reasonable Creature.</hi> We must cease to be reasonable, if a known and <hi>apprehended absent Good</hi> be not desir'd. The Soul hath as <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> an <hi>Appetite</hi> to good, as it hath an <hi>Aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from Evil; an Appetite (I say) to the <hi>receiving,</hi> tho not to the <hi>doing</hi> of Good. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of <hi>Grace</hi> are not more natural to <hi>holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Souls,</hi> than the Love of <hi>Rest and Ease</hi> is to the very worst of <hi>sinful Souls.</hi> If <hi>Heaven</hi> be revealed to a Sinner in Torments, as a state of <hi>Happiness and Tranquility,</hi> he cannot but covet it, tho he hath no Inclination to it as a state of <hi>Purity and sinless Perfection.</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:40872:43"/>Nature will produce such Desires as these; just as in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> notwithstanding all his <hi>hardness,</hi> who still <hi>intreated</hi> the removal of the several <hi>Plagues</hi> from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Desire of <hi>Relief</hi> is excited and <hi>increas't</hi> by the <hi>Duration</hi> of their Misery. As a Man's <hi>Thirst</hi> in a <hi>burning Feaver</hi> is more and more <hi>enflam'd</hi> and heighten'd by the continuance and <hi>progress</hi> of his Disease; the longer the Distemper lasts upon him, the greater is his Thirst; so 'tis here; the <hi>longer</hi> their Misery abides upon them in Hell, so much the <hi>more unsufferable</hi> it is, and somuch the <hi>more eager</hi> are they to get (if they could) some Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it. <hi>Custom</hi> which makes some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils <hi>familiar</hi> to us, makes us more <hi>quiet</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; but in this Case, the Soul is more <hi>impatient</hi> of them. The longer the Sinner <hi>hath born</hi> them, the greater <hi>tediousness</hi> he finds <hi>in bearing</hi> them; he is still the less satisfied with his Condition, and the more sollicitous to have it mended.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>letting loose</hi> of <hi>raging Passions</hi> in Hell is purposely <hi>order'd by God</hi> as an Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Torment. It is in the Power of God, (and his Prerogative alone it is) to <hi>restrain</hi> and tye up Men's <hi>Affections</hi> as he pleases; that the Soul shall not <hi>go forth</hi> to any Objects from which he hath a mind to keep it back. Or else how could he have made good that Promise to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>no Man should desire their Land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24. But when he will, he can also <hi>take off the Bridle,</hi> and leave Men to be their <hi>own Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:40872:43"/>by the vehemency of their own Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. So iti s in Hell; for <hi>insatiable restless Desires</hi> after that which is impossible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, are certainly an extraordinary <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> to <hi>Lust</hi> and not to <hi>have,</hi> yea to Lust strongly, when we <hi>cannot</hi> have, is a most woful Plague.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why are all Refreshments <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously withheld</hi> from damned Souls, tho passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately desir'd? There are divers Reasons tending to the Vindication of God's <hi>Justice</hi> in this Case As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because they did not <hi>acknowledge God</hi> in the <hi>Plenty</hi> which they once had, while they were on Earth. They that will not own their <hi>Benefactor,</hi> are deservedly punisht with the loss of all his <hi>Benefits;</hi> as was threaten'd to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> Deut. 28.47, 48. <hi>Because thou servedst not the Lord thy God with Joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and gladness of Heart for the abundance of all things; therefore thou shalt serve thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in Hunger and Thirst and Nakedness, and the want of all things.</hi> Sinners, while they live here upon God's <hi>bounty,</hi> regard him not, and therefore hereafter they shall be <hi>cut short</hi> as much. They receive <hi>Liberally</hi> now, and they see not the Hand that's <hi>open'd</hi> to them; therefore hereafter that hand shall be <hi>shut,</hi> and give out nothing for them to take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in. He whom <hi>they</hi> deny while their <hi>Cup runs over,</hi> will deny <hi>them</hi> at last.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40872:44"/> 2. Because all that they had from God, while they were in this World, they were ready to take it <hi>as their due;</hi> as if it were a <hi>Debt,</hi> ad not an <hi>Alms,</hi> as if it <hi>rightfully</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd, and were not <hi>freely</hi> communicated to them. It is just therefore, that in Hell they should find the contrary; <hi>viz.</hi> that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoyed any thing, but what was the meer Effect of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and what God might have withheld, if he had thought fit. The <hi>extream Penury</hi> of that State shall teach them, that when God <hi>filled them with good things,</hi> he might have <hi>sent them cleanness of Teeth;</hi> that he who is the Lord of <hi>both Worlds,</hi> might have dealt with them <hi>before,</hi> as he does <hi>now.</hi> God is <hi>kind to the unthankful and to the Evil</hi> in this World, <hi>Luke</hi> 6, 35. But they are not <hi>sensible</hi> of his Kindness; when it <hi>ceases</hi> in the next World, they will be sensible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because they <hi>enlarg'd their Desire as Hell, and would not be satisfied,</hi> while they had their abode on Earth, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.5. Small Matters would not <hi>Content</hi> them, while they were living here; a <hi>sufficiency</hi> would not serve; they must be, as <hi>job</hi> in his Prosperity was, <hi>c.</hi> 29.6. <hi>When he washed his Steps with Butter, and the Rock pour'd him out Rivers of Oil;</hi> or else they would be <hi>Cursing God in thier Hearts,</hi> and <hi>setting their Mouths against the Heavens.</hi> Daily <hi>Bread</hi> was not enough for them; they <hi>asked Meat,</hi> (like the <hi>Jews</hi> of Old) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their Necessity, but <hi>for their Lusts,</hi> Psalm 78.18. It is therefore a righteous thing that these <hi>losty</hi> Sinners should be <hi>brought
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40872:44"/>so low,</hi> as to value that which before they would have <hi>spilt upon the Ground;</hi> to seek those <hi>mean</hi> Refreshments which once they would have <hi>scorn'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Because they <hi>shew'd no Mercy,</hi> when they were <hi>capable</hi> of doing it, to those that were more <hi>indigent</hi> than themselves. Now they are punisht in <hi>their own Kind;</hi> they that <hi>draw out their Souls to the Hungry,</hi> are under a Promise that God will <hi>satisfie their Souls in Drought;</hi> Isa. 58.1, 11. The <hi>liberal Soul</hi> partakes of the <hi>Fatness of God's House</hi> in Heaven, while the Uncharitable <hi>Pine away</hi> in Hell. <hi>Job</hi> says, that he had <hi>not withheld the Poor from their desire, nor caused the Eyes of the Widow to fail, nor eaten his Morsel alone, without afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fatherless a share,</hi> c. 31.16, 17. But how can they expect to be reliev'd by God hereafter, that have <hi>sent</hi> so many <hi>empty away</hi> here, whom it was in their Power to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply? The Rich Man refused <hi>Crumbs</hi> to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> and is therefore denied a <hi>Drop</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>ƲSE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information.</hi> 1. If Souls have no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment in</hi> Hell, how much less will they have a <hi>release out</hi> of it? Who can look for a <hi>total Cessation</hi> of those Torments, of which he cannot obtain so much as a <hi>Partial Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?</hi> If the Sinner can have nothing to <hi>lessen</hi> his Misery, how can he think that any thing should ever <hi>put an end</hi> to it, which is a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40872:45"/>great deal more? The Rich Man's not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing for a little <hi>Water to cool</hi> his enflamed Tongue, is an unquestionable ground for a very uncomfortable Inference, that the <hi>Fire shall never be quenched;</hi> which for certainty's sake, our Lord recites three times over, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44, 46, 48. 2. <hi>Damned Souls</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not desire <hi>Ʋnion to their Bodies.</hi> This is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and justly desir'd by <hi>glorified Spirits,</hi> because that Re-union will compleat the Happiness of their <hi>whole Persons;</hi> but it will add to the wretchedness of the Damned, and for that Reason must needs be against their Wills. Their <hi>Punishment</hi> already is <hi>greater than they can bear;</hi> and if the Body were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be <hi>raised,</hi> and if in this Sense they were <hi>to lye down and not be gathered,</hi> (<hi>job</hi> 27.19) they would never repine. 3. <hi>Being it self</hi> is without doubt <hi>undesirable</hi> to the Damned. If they could return to their <hi>first nothing,</hi> or be turned to <hi>absolute Destruction,</hi> it would be better for them. like those, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.6. <hi>They seek Death, and find it not, and desire to Dye, but it flyes from them.</hi> There is no Man so fond of the Notion of <hi>Existence,</hi> but what would rather chuse <hi>not to be,</hi> than to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly miserable.</hi> Christ tells us in the Case of <hi>Judas, It had been good for that Man, if he had not been Born,</hi> Mat. 26.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. Despise the <hi>utmost Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of Men,</hi> when compared with what God inflicts in the next World. Humane Punishments cannot be so <hi>imbitter'd,</hi> but that there may be a <hi>sweetness mingled</hi> with them,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40872:45"/>and that sweetness <hi>predominant</hi> too. When Men do their <hi>worst</hi> to make <hi>our Sufferings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi> we may have (even more) <hi>abounding Consolation</hi> also, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. If they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us only the <hi>Water of Affliction,</hi> God can <hi>Tincture</hi> it with the <hi>rich Wine of the Kingdom.</hi> 2. Beware of <hi>resting</hi> in a meer <hi>desire of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from Hell;</hi> for that alone cannot be <hi>saving;</hi> there are desires of the <hi>same kind</hi> in Hell it self. Flatter not your selves with that as a Mark or <hi>Evidence of Grace,</hi> which (you see) is consistent with a <hi>state of actual Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> No Man would go to Hell, if wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to escape it were enough; or at least, no Man would be detained there, if the craving of Deliverance thence might be accepted with God. 3. Live in the <hi>diligent Pursuits of Heaven,</hi> where you will meet with the <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Reverse</hi> of all that hath been now said. God will deal with you there, as <hi>Solomon</hi> with the <hi>Queen of Sheba,</hi> 2 Chron. 9.12. <hi>Give you all your Desire,</hi> and vastly <hi>outdo it.</hi> God will <hi>do</hi> for you, beyond what you can <hi>think;</hi> future <hi>Enjoyment</hi> shall exceed all present <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi> You shall not ask <hi>drops of Water,</hi> but have <hi>Rivers of Pleasure,</hi> and swim in a full <hi>Ocean</hi> of Joy, without the least <hi>Drop</hi> of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to diminish it.</p>

               <p>THESE Words begins the <hi>Answer</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> made to the <hi>Rich Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> which is set down in the foregoing Verse; and this Answer consists of two Parts; the former Part of it tends to convince the Rich Man of the <hi>Equity</hi> of his request being <hi>denied,</hi> in this Verse; and the latter Part is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him likewise of the <hi>impossibility</hi> of its being <hi>fulfilled,</hi> in the Verse which follows. I shall first considerw hat relates to the <hi>Equity</hi> of the <hi>refusal</hi> in this Verse; <hi>But</hi> Abraham <hi>said,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In which part of the <hi>Answer</hi> we have these four things, the <hi>Title</hi> of the Person spoken to, the <hi>serious Act</hi> which he is put upon, the <hi>subject Matter</hi> of that Act, and a <hi>reasonable Inference</hi> propos'd from thence. 1. The <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> of the Person spoken to; <hi>[Son].</hi> As the Rich Man had called <hi>Abraham Father;</hi> so here <hi>Abraham</hi> calls him <hi>Son,</hi> as being Lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from him, and of his <hi>Seed according
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40872:46"/>to the Flesh,</hi> or because this was a common and customary Term, which <hi>Superiours</hi> made use of in speaking to their <hi>Inferiors.</hi> So <hi>Joshua</hi> to <hi>Achan, My Son,</hi> Josh. 7.19. And <hi>Eli</hi> to the Man that came out of the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.16. Nor is there any more <hi>Affection</hi> express't hereby, than by the usual Compellation of <hi>Friend,</hi> a Name sometimes given to real <hi>Enemies;</hi> as by <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Judas, Mat.</hi> 26.50. And to him that <hi>had not the Wedding-Garment,</hi> c. 22.12. who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>bound Hand and Foot and taken away, and cast into outer Darkness,</hi> v. 13. <hi>Names</hi> and Titles are poor dependances, and will do no kindness to those who <hi>are not</hi> as they <hi>are called,</hi> but rather serve to <hi>upbraid</hi> and shame them. <hi>Abraham's Children,</hi> that <hi>walk not in his Steps,</hi> will fall into the greater <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> if he be their <hi>Father,</hi> it will be enquir'd, where is their <hi>Faith,</hi> and their <hi>Obedience,</hi> in Imitation of his? For otherwise, such a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> will but make them the greater Sinners, and the more miserable. 2. The <hi>serious Act</hi> which he is put upon, <hi>[Remember].</hi> That Faculty which is so little improv'd, and so much perverted now, will be exercised here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, to the <hi>increase of thier Sorrow;</hi> for they will have <hi>Everlasting Leisure</hi> in Hell to review their Folly and Madness, while they liv'd on Earth. Those things which they would not <hi>apply their Hearts to</hi> in this World, they will not be able to avoid thinking o fin the next; as <hi>Jacob</hi> when he first heard of his <hi>Son's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest,</hi> seems to pass it over in Silence, <hi>Gen.</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:40872:47"/>35.22. But when he came to Dye, recollects it, and pronounces a sharp Censure upon it, <hi>c.</hi> 49.4. Men have their <hi>Arts of forgetfulness</hi> while they live, which are <hi>impracticable</hi> after Death; for the Sins which God <hi>retains,</hi> will be certainly brought to the Sinner's <hi>own</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. 3. The <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of this Act; which is Twofold, partly concerning himself, and partly referring to the Beggar. (1.) Concerning <hi>Himself; [That thou in thy Life-time receivedst thy good things].</hi> All the Effects of Divine <hi>Bounty,</hi> so far as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from that Spring, are truly stiled <hi>good things,</hi> tho of a <hi>temporal</hi> Kind; and this is the common Language of the Scripture, <hi>Psalm</hi> 103.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25. They are really good in their Measure and <hi>Degree,</hi> and capable of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very good <hi>Ends</hi> and Purposes, if they were not abus'd by our Corruption. But here they are emphatically term'd <hi>his</hi> good things, because in his <hi>Opinion</hi> and Esteem they were the <hi>best</hi> things; and because he took them for his <hi>share</hi> and chose them for his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;</hi> and because he manag'd and enjoy'd them, as if he were not the <hi>meer Steward</hi> of them, but had an uncontroulable and <hi>absolute Propriety</hi> in them. These Things the Rich Man was to remember, had been given him <hi>in his Life-time;</hi> he had worn out his <hi>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Season</hi> already; Providence had indulg'd him during that <hi>space,</hi> in what his <hi>Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd,</hi> tho now an End was put to all those Fruitions. (2.) That which referr'd to the <hi>Leggar; [And likewise</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things</hi>].
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40872:47"/>Afflictions and Sufferings are properly <hi>Evils,</hi> tho they <hi>Work for good;</hi> their Operations and Issues do not alter their <hi>Nature.</hi> Now the <hi>Lot</hi> which was appointed and assign'd to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> consisted <hi>mostly of such</hi> things; and the <hi>same Hand,</hi> by the guidance of unerring Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, distributed <hi>both;</hi> that which was <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to the one, and <hi>grievous</hi> to the other; for <hi>Evil</hi> is received at the <hi>Hands of God,</hi> as well as <hi>Good,</hi> Job 2.10. He disposes and <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to all,</hi> according as he sees fit. 4. A <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Inference</hi> propounded from hence; [<hi>But now he</hi> (i. e. <hi>Lazarus</hi>) <hi>is Comforted and thou art Tormented.</hi>] He that took his <hi>turn of Misery</hi> before, is now advanc't to a state of Happiness, and thou who hast taken thy <hi>turn of Happiness,</hi> art justly thrust down to a state of Misery; God hath recompenc't his Poverty with <hi>Riches in Glory,</hi> and he hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht thy Sensuality with Extremity of want. Thou couldst not expect, that thou shouldst be Happy, or he be Miserable, in <hi>both Worlds;</hi> but as he preferr'd the Delights of Heaven to the <hi>Pleasures of Sin,</hi> so he now possesses them, and as thou hast chosen the Pleasures of Sin, tho follow'd with the Torments of Hell, so now thou art righteously Sentenc'd to endure them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To shew, on what <hi>Terms</hi> these <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Blessings</hi> are afforded to wicked Men on Earth. <hi>Ans.</hi> In five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are sometimes given in Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>some piece of Service</hi> done to God, or to his People. Bad Men may in some Cases perform Actions <hi>materially</hi> Good; tho nothing <hi>savingly profitable</hi> to themselves, yet things <hi>publickly useful</hi> and beneficial to others, and to the Interest of Christ in the World. Now tho God <hi>deserve</hi> all this, and a great deal more and better at their Hands, and is so much <hi>beforehand</hi> with them, hat they can challenge <hi>no requital,</hi> yet he does generally <hi>overpay</hi> them for their greater Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God hath his <hi>differing Rewards</hi> for differing Persons; <hi>Eternal</hi> recompences for the Good, and <hi>Temporal</hi> ones for the Bad. The Men of the Earth are as God's <hi>hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> when they do any thing for him, they seldom <hi>do it for nought.</hi> We have a signal instance; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.18, 19, 20. <hi>Son of Man,</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>King of</hi> Babylon <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Army to serve a great Service against</hi> Tyrus, <hi>yet had he no Wages, nor his Army for it; therefore behold I will give him the Land
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40872:48"/>of</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c. Because they wrought for me, saith the Lord God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They are given them as <hi>their Portion. David</hi> prays to be deliver'd from the <hi>Men of the World, who have their Portion in this Life,</hi> Psalm 17.14. <hi>i. e.</hi> Their <hi>whole</hi> Portion made up of the <hi>things of this Life.</hi> When God gives out <hi>all the Good</hi> that he ever designs to give to this or that Man, it is call'd his <hi>Portion,</hi> as when the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> upon the Division of his Father's Estate, took that <hi>Part of it which fell to him,</hi> Luke 15.12. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he gave all his Haereditary Possessions to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac,</hi> the promised Seed, in whose Veins the <hi>Blood of the Covenant ran,</hi> yet to the <hi>Sons of the Concubines</hi> which he had, he gave <hi>Gifts</hi> also, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.5, 6. He did not send them away <hi>empty,</hi> but gave them what they were to expect from him, <hi>at once,</hi> during his own Life. Thus God deals with the <hi>Children of this World;</hi> tho he does not make them <hi>Joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs</hi> with <hi>his own,</hi> who are <hi>Joynt-heirs with Christ,</hi> (typified by <hi>Isaac</hi>) yet he allows them for their present <hi>liberal Maintenance,</hi> as his Creatures and <hi>off-spring</hi> in general.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are given them in Compliance with their own <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Choice.</hi> God <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers them in the Joy of their Heart,</hi> Eccl. 5.20. He grants them according to what they <hi>wish,</hi> and suffers them to please themselves; he sets two <hi>Worlds</hi> before them, <hi>seen</hi> Things <hi>in Hand,</hi> and <hi>unseen</hi> Things <hi>in Hope;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they incline to that which is Visible and Present (as <hi>of our selves</hi> we all should do)
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40872:49"/>he lets them have it, and try how Happy they can be made by it. As when <hi>Samuel</hi> had told the People the <hi>manner of the King that should Reign over them,</hi> how Arbitrary and Tyrannical, and yet they would not be disswaded, but still insisted on being <hi>like the rest of the Nations,</hi> God says, <hi>Hearken to their Voice, and make them a King,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.22. Let it be to them, as they require and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve that it shall be; set up that <hi>Form of Government</hi> among them, which they are so fond of, and when they come to smart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, as I have forewarn'd them, they may thank themselves. So here; 'tis Men's Folly to <hi>ask Riches and Wealth</hi> (contrary to 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.11.) and God yeilds to their Request.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are given as <hi>Trials of their Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Worldly Men are very apt indeed to think themselves <hi>Lords,</hi> and call these things <hi>their own,</hi> as if not <hi>accountable</hi> to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; so <hi>Nabal</hi> proudly and churlishly speaks of <hi>his</hi> Bread, and <hi>his</hi> Water, and <hi>his</hi> Flesh, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.11. But when God speaks of such things, he changes the style, and alters the <hi>Property;</hi> I will take away <hi>my</hi> Corn, and <hi>my Wine,</hi> and recover <hi>my</hi> Wool and <hi>my</hi> Flax, <hi>&amp;c. Hos.</hi> 2.9. He does not say Yours, but Mine. The Things of this World are strictly <hi>committed to their Trust,</hi> and they are truly oblig'd to be <hi>faithful in the unrighteous Mammon,</hi> v. 11. of this Chap. God knows very well that they will not be so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>proves</hi> them; and therefore the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment is not made for <hi>his own</hi> Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40872:49"/>(as <hi>Christ</hi> once put a Question to <hi>Philip,</hi> to prove him, when he himself <hi>knew what he would do,</hi> John 6.6.) But <hi>others</hi> do not know, nor they <hi>themselves,</hi> what Corruption is in them, till discover'd by such means.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are given in <hi>Judgment</hi> to them, not in <hi>Mercy;</hi> as appears by the <hi>Event.</hi> They that <hi>will be Rich</hi> (and whom God permits to obtain their Will) <hi>fall into Temptation and a Snare,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.9. the infinitely Wise God foresees how hurtful and mischievous these things will be to their <hi>greedy Owners,</hi> before they compass them; and therefore 'tis an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his <hi>displeasure,</hi> that he does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or disappoint them. Whatsoever God gives, <hi>without his Effectual Grace,</hi> for a due Improvement of it, and escape of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations belonging to it, is certainly <hi>given in Anger,</hi> rather than in Love. <hi>Psalm</hi> 69.22. <hi>Let their Table become a Snare before them,</hi> &amp;c. Do not we take that for a <hi>Curse</hi> upon the Sinner's Prosperity? And how can this Curse be avoided, where Grace is denied, as an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote</hi> against the <hi>sweet,</hi> but <hi>killing Poison?</hi> As <hi>Judas</hi>'s Discipleship made way for his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (he could never have <hi>betrayed Christ,</hi> if he had not been so <hi>familiar</hi> with him) so their flourishing prepares for their Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why will outward Blessings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd on Earth, be <hi>sadly remember'd</hi> by wicked Men in Hell? <hi>Ans.</hi> The Reasons are very Evident; it must needs be so, because.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:40872:50"/> 1. 'Tis a <hi>miserable</hi> things for a Man to <hi>have been Happy,</hi> and to out-live his Felicity. They who <hi>never possest</hi> any thing desirable, cannot so well <hi>feel the loss</hi> of it. To think of what we <hi>did enjoy,</hi> and are <hi>now</hi> condemn'd to a <hi>perpetual want of,</hi> is most tormenting. A Sinner that hath <hi>merrily spent his Day,</hi> will have <hi>melancholy reflections</hi> upon it, when <hi>Night comes.</hi> 'Tis dreadful to consider, that all his Pleasure is <hi>gone,</hi> and the <hi>Place</hi> where he took his fill of it, must <hi>know him no more.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> in his time of Banishment from the Sanctuary, <hi>remember'd that he had gone with the Multitude</hi> of Devout Worshippers to the House of God, it almost overwhelm'd him, <hi>Psalm</hi> 42.4. So <hi>Jerusalem remember'd in the Days of her Affliction and Misery, all her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant things which she had in the Days of Old,</hi> Lam. 1.7. So 'tis dismal for a Soul shut up in the <hi>Bottomless Pit,</hi> to <hi>remember from whence it hath fallen;</hi> how it hath been <hi>plunged</hi> from the <hi>Pinnacle</hi> of worldly Happiness into those <hi>Depths</hi> of irrecoverable Wo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They will be <hi>stung</hi> with a Sence of their <hi>Folly,</hi> in over-valuing things so <hi>unserviceable</hi> to them at their <hi>greatest need.</hi> They now find, that the <hi>Riches</hi> which they magnified, and trusted in, <hi>Profit not in the Day of Wrath,</hi> Prov. 11.4. Their <hi>strong City</hi> is beaten down, and the <hi>high Wall in their own Conceit,</hi> (like those of <hi>Jericho</hi>) is now laid flat. They find, that their <hi>gallantry</hi> and greatness was no <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> against the force of Infinite Vengeance;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40872:50"/>for they have fared, like <hi>Agag,</hi> the King of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who tho he <hi>came delicately,</hi> was <hi>hewn in Pieces,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.32, 33. What a Price did I set (will the once <hi>Wealthy</hi> Sinner say) upon my <hi>great Possessions,</hi> which stood all for sorry <hi>worthless Cyphers</hi> at the approach of Death and Judgment? What am I the <hi>better</hi> now for that which I madly thought to be my <hi>chiefest Good?</hi> What have I done in <hi>leaning on</hi> such weak and wretched <hi>Supports,</hi> which have all failed me, and are utterly withdrawn from Me? How blind was I to make <hi>Gold my Confidence,</hi> instead of God? Like the Idolaters that <hi>lay bold</hi> upon feeble Deities, which cannot <hi>bear them up,</hi> 2 Chron. 7.22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Thoughts of these things will be the more <hi>uneasie,</hi> in that they were <hi>bewitcht</hi> by them into a total <hi>forgetfulness of God,</hi> and of their <hi>main Concernments.</hi> these very things diverted and put them by from <hi>chusing the good Part,</hi> which would <hi>never have been taken away from them;</hi> these sensual Delights on Earth kept them from having any <hi>Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Heaven.</hi> These <hi>broken Cisterns</hi> made them <hi>forsake the Living Fountain;</hi> this <hi>outward Plenty</hi> led them to be regardless of their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Poverty.</hi> In minding and pursuing earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things, they neglected their <hi>Souls</hi> and all that was Spiritual; like <hi>Saul,</hi> and his <hi>Servant,</hi> who went about <hi>seeking his Father's Asses</hi> so long, till they almost lost themselves, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.5. Will not the remembrance of this be very perplexing? That for such Vanities and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40872:51"/>Trifles they should wast all their <hi>Time,</hi> and hazard their <hi>Eternity?</hi> How may they Curse the Day wherein they were <hi>made Rich,</hi> and when the <hi>Glory of their House was increased?</hi> If they had been <hi>poorer in this World,</hi> perhaps they might have been <hi>Richer towards God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Conscience</hi> will be always <hi>reckoning up,</hi> and upbraiding them with, their particular <hi>sinful Abuses</hi> of these things. As <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>a Book of Remembrance written before him,</hi> (his own Omniscience being a perfect Register of all our Sins) so the <hi>Sinner</hi> himself hath a Book of remembrance too in <hi>his own Bosom;</hi> he <hi>carries</hi> it about with him now, (as <hi>Ʋriah</hi> did the <hi>Letter</hi> from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Joab</hi>) but he <hi>reads</hi> it not; whereas in Hell it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>open,</hi> and he continually <hi>poring</hi> in it. And how many numberless Abominations will he find <hi>recorded</hi> there? He <hi>threw away his Talents,</hi> he cared not how, so that he might but gratisie his Lust; he consulted no <hi>Rule,</hi> confin'd himself to no <hi>Measure,</hi> in his use of these Things; but Conscience all this while kept a strict and faithful <hi>Account,</hi> and and in the next World this account will be all <hi>call'd over,</hi> and <hi>spread</hi> like the Prophet's <hi>Roll,</hi> which was <hi>written within and without, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and Mourning, and Wo,</hi> Ezek. 2.10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Devil,</hi> who hath been their <hi>success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tempter</hi> by these things, will be also their <hi>Everlasting Troubler.</hi> Satan is most ready to <hi>accuse</hi> those now, whom he <hi>cannot prevailing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempt;</hi> as <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Mistress charg'd him <hi>falsly</hi> with the wickedness which she could by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40872:51"/>no means allure him to commit; but <hi>these</hi> Accusations can do <hi>no harm,</hi> tho they may give <hi>some Disturbance,</hi> till the Soul is <hi>clear'd</hi> from them by the <hi>Witness of the Spirit.</hi> The Case of the <hi>Damned</hi> is much otherwise; they lye open to the foulest <hi>Charges</hi> from this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser, and have no <hi>Advocate</hi> to defend them; <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath already Sentenc'd them, and their own <hi>Hearts reproach them</hi> on the very same Score; so that here the Devil hath an Advantage against them, which his Malice will be ever improving. If he will trouble <hi>Believers</hi> with <hi>lying Calumnies,</hi> how much more will he torment the <hi>Sinner,</hi> when he hath <hi>Truth</hi> on his side? The <hi>Prince of this World</hi> will industriously put them in mind, with what empty Toyes he <hi>charm'd</hi> them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How is the <hi>Justice</hi> of God <hi>vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> hereby? For God will be <hi>clear when he judgeth,</hi> and the Condemned shall be <hi>speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. Ans.</hi> In this Case we may consider, That</p>
               <p n="1">1. These <hi>good Things</hi> which they receiv'd, were <hi>truly</hi> good in their <hi>Original,</hi> and in their <hi>Tendency,</hi> and became <hi>Evil to them,</hi> meerly by <hi>their own Means.</hi> They were good in their Original, as they <hi>came down from</hi> God, <hi>James</hi> 1.17. And good in their Tendency, as they would <hi>carry back</hi> a thankful Receiver <hi>unto</hi> God. They <hi>might</hi> have used them as <hi>steps to ascend</hi> to Heaven by, and <hi>ought</hi> to have
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40872:52"/>done so. A delightful <hi>Paradise</hi> was an help to <hi>Adam</hi> in raising up his Heart to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Creator, till Sin corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd him. Souls should be <hi>drawn</hi> to God even with outward Mercies, as with <hi>Bands of Love,</hi> Hos. 11.4. 'Tis <hi>unnatural</hi> to be <hi>weaned</hi> from him by the <hi>Kindness</hi> which he shews to us; and yet if we were not so wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our good Things could do us no Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but would be <hi>doubly</hi> beneficial.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a <hi>distinguishing Providence</hi> in the giving of these things to them. <hi>All the Members</hi> of God's <hi>Family</hi> had not <hi>such large</hi> Supplies. Others <hi>more Righteous than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> received <hi>evil things</hi> at the same time, as we read in the Text. They <hi>sate at ease,</hi> while the Church of God was <hi>afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,</hi> Isa. 54.11. They had a <hi>smooth</hi> Passage thro the World, while many excellent Saints were dealt very <hi>roughly</hi> with, and encounter'd a great many Difficulties in their way. Providence was <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable</hi> to them, when it was more <hi>severe</hi> to better Men. And therefore if such <hi>Clemency</hi> hath harden'd them, when the <hi>Rigour</hi> of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity hath wrought contrary Effects upon others, their <hi>Demnation</hi> must needs be <hi>Just.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Their <hi>life time</hi> was a <hi>suffcient time</hi> of Tryal; they had these good things <hi>long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi> to see, whether they would be <hi>better'd</hi> by them or not. They spent <hi>their days in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, and their years in pleasure;</hi> so there can be no room for complaint, that they were <hi>snatcht</hi> out of their hands, before they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40872:52"/>had any <hi>opportunity</hi> of <hi>doing good with</hi> them, or of <hi>getting good from</hi> them. They liv'd under the exercise of God's <hi>patient forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> as well as extraordinary bounty. It was one of the <hi>posing</hi> Questions which <hi>Job</hi> put to his friends, concerning the prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously wicked, <hi>Wherefore do they live and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come old? Job</hi> 21.7. as if it were hard to reconcile it to the <hi>righteousness</hi> of God, that they are permitted <hi>so long</hi> a life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis plain, that he cannot be impeacht for making their space and season of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>too short.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>suffering Saints</hi> were <hi>sufficient warnings</hi> to them, of what they must look for. God is never <hi>moved</hi> to destroy or afflict <hi>without a cause;</hi> Now, if there be a cause for his <hi>afflicting</hi> of good men in this World, there is much more cause for his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying</hi> of bad men in the next. If Saints for <hi>lesser provocations</hi> (comparatively) receive <hi>Temporal</hi> Evils here, Sinners for their <hi>greater Indignities</hi> can expect no less than <hi>Eternal</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils hereafter. If they whom God hath <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen out</hi> of the World, be <hi>sorely chasten'd,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> out of which they are chosen, must conclude upon being <hi>finally condemned.</hi> The <hi>Rich Man</hi> might have read his own <hi>Doom</hi> in <hi>Lazarus</hi> his <hi>Beggary;</hi> that was a <hi>token mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest</hi> enough, if he had consider'd it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. <hi>If Judgment first begin at us, what shall the End be of them that obey not the Gospel of God?</hi>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>ƲSE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information.</hi> 1. They that <hi>call the rich happy,</hi> are much <hi>mistaken,</hi> and give them a Character which they <hi>least deserve.</hi> In a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while we may ask them, as <hi>Paul</hi> did his <hi>Galatians,</hi> and they will not be able to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>Where is the Blessedness you spake of?</hi> Those cutting Words of <hi>Christ</hi> will speedily take Place; <hi>Luke</hi> 6.24. <hi>Wo to you that are Rich, for you have receiv'd your Consolation.</hi> Such a time is coming, wherein this will be verified in them; for the Consolations which they are <hi>now receiving,</hi> cannot be durable, <hi>Psalm</hi> 49.17, 18. <hi>When he dyeth, he shall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nothing away, his Glory shall not descend af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; tho while he lived, he blessed his Soul,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Those things will help to <hi>perpetuate</hi> a Man's <hi>Misery in Hell,</hi> which will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate his <hi>Name on Earth.</hi> His <hi>Remembrance</hi> soon decaies and <hi>perishes</hi> here, but his <hi>guilt</hi> is continually <hi>revived</hi> there; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.10. <hi>I saw the Wicked buried, who had come and gone from the Place of the Holy, and they were forgotten in the City where they had so done.</hi> It is spoken of ungodly <hi>Rulers,</hi> whose Memories, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all their Grandeur and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicence, <hi>rot</hi> in the Places where they lived; but yet their own Memory of the wickednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they committed, <hi>remains</hi> with them after Death. 3.

Men that are most averse to the bearing of their <hi>present Crosses,</hi> would eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough embrace a share in their <hi>Eternal Comforts;</hi> they would not go thro the <hi>Valley of Trouble</hi> with them, but when they <hi>enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Peace,</hi> they will desire to <hi>follow their Steps.</hi> Every sinful Worldling will be as <hi>Sick of his own Portion</hi> in the End, as <hi>Babylon</hi> will be, when her <hi>Plagues</hi> come to be weigh'd and measur'd out in <hi>Proportion</hi> to her Ease, and Honour and Wealth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. <hi>How much she hath glorified her self, and lived deliciously, so much Torment and Sorrow give her.</hi>

That you may not remember them and be tormented, when the End comes.

Do not take up with these, as your <hi>All;</hi> as if you were sent (as one says) like <hi>Swallows</hi> into the World, only to gather a few <hi>Sticks and Dirt</hi> for a <hi>Nest</hi> wherein to <hi>breed up</hi> your Young, and then <hi>fly away.</hi> God had a nobler

                  <hi>design</hi> in Man's Creation, which 'tis our <hi>fault,</hi> that we come short of. 3.

               <p>Where we have two Things, an <hi>Assertion</hi> laid down, and the <hi>Consequence</hi> of it. 1. An <hi>Assertion</hi> laid down <hi>[Between us and you there is a great Gulph fixed]</hi> particularly. (1.) A

                  <hi>great Gulph.</hi> Not like that <hi>space</hi> between the two Hills on which <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abner</hi> stood, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.13.

'Tis not a <hi>movable</hi> boundary, which may be contracted and enlarg'd, or continued and taken away <hi>at Pleasure,</hi> but stands firm, like those <hi>Mountains of Brass,</hi> Zach. 6.1. whereby some understand the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Decrees and Immutable Purposes of God. (3.) 'Tis sixed <hi>between us and you,</hi> i. e. Between <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the rest of the glorified in Heaven, and the <hi>Rich Man,</hi> and the rest of the Damned in Hell; for <hi>both Parties</hi> are here mention'd in the <hi>Plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> The <hi>World to eome</hi> is divided into two <hi>contrary Regions</hi> (more contrary than any <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> in this World can be) and all <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> betwixt the People belonging to them, is utterly <hi>cut off.</hi> 2. The <hi>Consequence</hi> of what is here asserted; which is twofold; (1.) <hi>So that they which would pass from hence to you, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> This does not in the least imply, that any of the glorified do <hi>actually</hi> desire to go from Heaven to Hell, in Pity to the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but the meaning is, that if it could be <hi>supposed,</hi> that they should desire it, yet they could not do it; if <hi>Abraham</hi> had been incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to send <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> had been willing to be sent, to minister that relief to the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40872:55"/>
                  <hi>Rich Man</hi> which he requested, yet <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s coming to him would have been an insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Difficulty. 2. <hi>Neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</hi> The Damned cannot visit the Glorified, nor stir a step to relieve themselves; as <hi>Shimei</hi> was to <hi>dwell in his House, and not go forth thence any whither,</hi> 1 Kings 2.36. They cannot change their <hi>Place,</hi> nor their <hi>Company,</hi> but are tyed, and staked down to doth. They <hi>separated</hi> good Men from their Communion here, and they shall <hi>not be admitted</hi> into good Men's Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hereafter; as that murmuring Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>despis'd the pleasant Land</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were never suffer'd to set a Foot in it, but all their <hi>Carkasses fell in the Wilderness,</hi> Numb. 14.32.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To prove, that the wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Damned Souls is indeed <hi>unalterable.</hi> There are several Arguments which may be drawn from Scripture, for the Evincing, and Corroborating of this Truth. As</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:40872:56"/> 1. There is no <hi>Living again</hi> after Death, in such a <hi>Manner</hi> or to such a <hi>Purpose,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Dead Bodies ('tis true) will live again, but not till the Dissolution of the World, and then it will not <hi>mend</hi> the Case, but <hi>make it worse.</hi> What Alteration can there be <hi>for the better</hi> in the state of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, unless they could be allow'd to <hi>come back</hi> and <hi>rectifie</hi> the Errors they were guilty of in their former Time of Life? Now this can never be; the Scripture hath declar'd against it in many Places. <hi>Job</hi> 7.9. <hi>As the Cloud is consumed, and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to the Grave, shall come up no more.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>c.</hi> 16.22. <hi>When a few Days are come, then I shall go the Way, whence I shall not return.</hi> If it be appointed to Men <hi>once to Dye,</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they are to <hi>Live but once;</hi> for there is no Life upon Earth, but what ends and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in Death. We have but one Life, wherein to <hi>flee from the Wrath to come,</hi> and are not to look for another, when that Wrath hath <hi>overtaken</hi> us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the <hi>Hopes</hi> of miserable Sinners <hi>End with their Lives;</hi> which is Evidence enough, that there can be no Alteration of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition afterwards. The Scripture says, <hi>When a Wicked Man dyeth, his Expectation shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi> Prov. 11.7. And, <hi>They that go down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pit, cannot Hope for God's Truth,</hi> Isa. 38.18. Every carnal Man and his vain Hope, <hi>dye together;</hi> they usually <hi>languish,</hi> but always <hi>expire,</hi> at the same Time. Upon a <hi>Bed of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40872:56"/>Sickness</hi> they commonly grow <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>faint;</hi> but when the Spirit comes to be resign'd, they are as the <hi>giving up of the Ghost.</hi> A Sinner's hope never <hi>survives</hi> him so much as one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and yet why should it not, if after this there were the least possibility of a Change? Where any <hi>Possibility</hi> is, Hope will still abide, and fasten upon it; and therefore if <hi>all Hope be taken away,</hi> 'tis a plain Sign, that there is not any ground to Encourage or Support it. The <hi>Despair</hi> which seizes Damned Souls, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon as they leave their Bodies, shews their State to be utterly <hi>remediless.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Door of Mercy</hi> is <hi>finally shut</hi> against all Persons <hi>dying</hi> in thier Sins. It is <hi>shut</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Persons <hi>Living</hi> in their Sins, but not <hi>finally.</hi> Mat. 7.7. <hi>Knock, and it shall be open'd unto you.</hi> Opening implies a shutting; but that which is finally shut, is never open'd. Sinner's here are <hi>within the reach</hi> of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, if they have Faith to lay hold of it, and improve it to their own Benefit; but this Promise is <hi>out of Date,</hi> assoon as Life ceases. <hi>Afterwards came the other Virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> (i. e. after the Door was shut, they came) <hi>but he answer'd and said, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I say unto you, I know you not,</hi> Mat. 25.11, 12. Hence it is that Christ tells us, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will seek to enter in, and shall not be able,</hi> Luke 13.24. All seeking, and striving too, how earnest soever, if the season be past, will be ineffectual; and the <hi>season</hi> must needs be past, when our <hi>Time in general</hi> is quite spent; for the <hi>Day of Grace</hi> (at longest) never out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasted the <hi>Day of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:40872:57"/> 4. It is upon this account, and can be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other, that the <hi>Judgment to come</hi> is sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Eternal Judgment,</hi> Heb. 6.2. It cannot be said to be <hi>Eternal</hi> in respect of the <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Administration,</hi> but only with a regard to the <hi>Effect and Issue</hi> of it. Tho the <hi>Eternal God</hi> be the Judge, yet the <hi>Act</hi> of Judgment is not Eternal, but the <hi>results</hi> and consequences of it are so. <hi>How long</hi> the Day of Judgment will last, is a Controversie which I shall not enter into, but leave it among the <hi>secret things which belong to God;</hi> this is certain, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Controversie, that he will not be <hi>always judging;</hi> for if the <hi>Trial</hi> were to hold always, when should the <hi>Execution</hi> be? But the Judgment which God passes upon the Sinner, will be everlastingly <hi>Decisive,</hi> and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which he pronounces, will be <hi>Irreversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> There is no <hi>Appeal</hi> from <hi>this Tribunal</hi> to any other, nor will any <hi>Cause</hi> come before this Tribunal a <hi>second Time;</hi> but <hi>that which God does, it shall be for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is for this Reason, that <hi>Hell</hi> is set forth not only by a <hi>Prison,</hi> but such an one, as there is no escape or <hi>discharge from,</hi> The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of <hi>the Spirits in Prison, i. e.</hi> Souls in Hell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. A Prison, where they are in <hi>safest Custody,</hi> and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver break away, or obtain a <hi>Release,</hi> Mat. 5.26. <hi>Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost Farthing.</hi> There is no <hi>Goal-delivery</hi> here; the <hi>Debts</hi> which are not <hi>forgiven in this World,</hi> are never forgiven <hi>in the World to come.</hi> The
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40872:57"/>
                  <hi>strictest Confinements</hi> on this side of Hell are not so hopeless, but that our <hi>Freedom</hi> some way or other may be <hi>recoverable;</hi> whereas the <hi>Gates of Hell</hi> are made so <hi>sure,</hi> that the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of getting through them, would be as vain, as the attempt at <hi>Babel,</hi> of <hi>building a Tower that should reach to Heaven.</hi> Every Soul there is put into <hi>stronger Fetters,</hi> than those that are <hi>laid in Iron;</hi> Fetters not to be <hi>worn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder,</hi> nor <hi>taken off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Devils</hi> are <hi>set forth as Examples</hi> of God's intended dealing with unrepenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. As <hi>they</hi> shall never regain the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which they have lost, but are condemn'd to perpetual Misery; So the <hi>Souls</hi> which are <hi>under their influence</hi> now, must look to be dealt with hereafter, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. <hi>The Angels which kept not their first Estate, but left their own Habitation, he hath reserv'd in Everlasting Chains under Darkness to the Judgment of the great Day.</hi> God hath <hi>cast them down</hi> so low, that they shall never <hi>rise more;</hi> and this he did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, assoon as ever they <hi>fell;</hi> and they have never had the least <hi>single offer of Grace</hi> since, nor ever shall have. Now if God hath been so severely and inexorably just to such noble Creatures <hi>Superior to us,</hi> in laying such a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment upon them, not to be remov'd, for their <hi>first Offence,</hi> he will certainly not be less just to those that continue <hi>sinning wilfully all their Days</hi> under the Means of Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:40872:58"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Whence</hi> is it that the miserable state of the Damned is thus unalterable? What are the true and proper <hi>Causes</hi> of its being so? <hi>Ans.</hi> We may resolve it into the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Power of God</hi> which is <hi>Irresistible,</hi> makes the state of the Damned unalterable. He <hi>by his Strength setteth fast the Mountains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing girded with Power.</hi> Psalm 65.6. He <hi>hath established the Earth, and it abideth.</hi> Psalm 119.90. And those <hi>Rocks</hi> which the Prophet calls the <hi>Bars of the Earth.</hi> Jon. 2.6. Are firmly plac'd by his Almighty Hand, so as that no other Hand can move them. The Waters of the <hi>Sea</hi> are kept within bounds of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, which they cannot pass over; He hath said, <hi>Here shall thy proud Waves be stayed,</hi> and so they are, <hi>Job</hi> 38.11. Now Hell is as much within the <hi>Verge of Omnipotence,</hi> as any Part of God's Creation; and therefore what can they do, to help themselves, or <hi>deliver their own Souls,</hi> that have the <hi>strong Lord God to judge them?</hi> They who cannot change any of the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God in Nature, how will they do to rescue themselves from his <hi>Armed Vengeance?</hi> He that is able to Guide and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the whole <hi>Course of this World,</hi> and bring about his own Glory by every Action and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, in despite of all that does oppose it, how easily can he <hi>detain</hi> a Company of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Malefactors</hi> under that Wrath which he Dooms them to? Whom he <hi>Binds,</hi> none can <hi>Loose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:40872:58"/> 2. The <hi>Will of God,</hi> which is <hi>invariable,</hi> makes the state of the Damned to be so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. He is a God, whose <hi>Counsel stands for ever,</hi> whose Purposes and Determinations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not, and <hi>from whose Eyes Repentance is hid.</hi> Whatever God wills to be, must needs be <hi>so</hi> as he wills it; and under all the <hi>changes</hi> and turnings of Providence, his Mind is still but <hi>one,</hi> and that one Mind is most infallibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht. We see in the Affairs of this Life many times, repeated endeavours of <hi>emerging out of a low Condition,</hi> which still come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as Vessels that are <hi>tugg'd up</hi> a little way against a Stream, and then <hi>carried back</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; of which no other Reason can be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, but that God hath appointed such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for them. How much less can they, of whom God hath said, that they <hi>shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Everlasting Destruction,</hi> 2 Thess. 1.9. Out-live this Destruction, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themselves from the Eternity of their Punishment? If this could be done, we must not only suppose Divine <hi>Power</hi> to be <hi>van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht,</hi> but the Divine <hi>Pleasure</hi> to be <hi>changed</hi> also; for if God do not go back from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Resolution, Sinners can never <hi>shake off their Bands of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How <hi>reasonable</hi> it is, that the state of the Damned should be thus unalterable?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because they <hi>would not</hi> come under a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying and <hi>saving Change,</hi> while they were in this World. They would not alter their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40872:59"/>
                  <hi>sanful Course</hi> here, and there their <hi>miserable State</hi> shall not be alter'd, tho they would. God is often solliciting, urging, requiring, intreating of them now, but they are <hi>obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately Bent</hi> against it; instead of turning <hi>from</hi> their Course, they <hi>turn to it,</hi> Jer. 8.6. As long as God forbears them, their <hi>Hearts are fully set to do Evil,</hi> Eccl. 8.11. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he comes to reckon with them, 'tis a very just requital, that the <hi>Gulph</hi> should be <hi>fixed.</hi> While Judgment is deferr'd and suspended, they <hi>will go on,</hi> in their Road of Wickedness; when Judgment is ripe for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and Execution begins, God <hi>will go on</hi> in his way of threatened displeasure. They would have spent an <hi>Eternity in Sin,</hi> if they might have had it to spend; they would <hi>never leave off</hi> the pursuign of their Lusts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Wrath will <hi>hold on</hi> the pursuit of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because they remain <hi>Impenitent,</hi> even in the midst of <hi>all their Misery.</hi> As they find <hi>no Place for Repentance,</hi> so they have <hi>no Hearts to it.</hi> Their <hi>Judgments</hi> indeed are chang'd in Hell, but their <hi>Wills</hi> are not; they have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>Conviction,</hi> but not the least foot-steps of <hi>Conversion.</hi> They are as full of Enmity against God, as ever they were, and really as much unconcern'd for the <hi>Evil of Sin,</hi> tho pierced through with the <hi>Evil of Suffering.</hi> Among all their <hi>Weepings and Wailings,</hi> there is not a drop of true <hi>godly Sorrow.</hi> They are as <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Wicked</hi> as before, and discover it as they can; like that unconverted <hi>Thief</hi> who <hi>railed</hi> at our Lord Christ, when he hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40872:59"/>the <hi>Cross</hi> by him; to whom the other said well, <hi>Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same Condemnation? Luke</hi> 23.40. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Idolaters</hi> are the lively <hi>Emblems</hi> of the Damned in this respect; for they under all the <hi>Plagues</hi> which are sent upon them, <hi>Blaspheme and Repent not,</hi> Rev. 9.20, 21. <hi>c.</hi> 16.9, 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Alteration of their Condition</hi> would not make for the better, while <hi>they themselves</hi> continued <hi>the same.</hi> Unless they had <hi>other Spirits</hi> given them, it would signifie nothing to put them into <hi>another State.</hi> If God were to <hi>try</hi> the same Persons again and again, the <hi>Issue</hi> would be still the same; as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Judgments inflicted and recalled, <hi>would not let</hi> Israel <hi>go,</hi> and so God honour'd himself upon him at last in his utter Ruine. Souls in that <hi>burning Furnace</hi> are not <hi>melted,</hi> but <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd</hi> rather; and what could be expected from a Sinner that is still <hi>incorrigible,</hi> but <hi>fresh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,</hi> if God after he had shut him up in Prison, should set him at Liberty again? <hi>New Opportunities</hi> and <hi>Temptations</hi> would infallibly produce more <hi>new Sins.</hi> The Scripture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells how unsuccessful Mercies would be, where Sin is yet in Dominion; <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.10. <hi>Let favour be shewed to the Wicked, yet will not he learn Righteousness.</hi> So that the removal of Judgment from them only, would do them no kindness.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sinners can <hi>never make Satisfaction</hi> to the Justice of God for <hi>any one</hi> Act or Thought of wickedness by <hi>all</hi> that they can suffer; and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40872:60"/>therefore there is a Necessity that they should <hi>suffer always.</hi> They can never <hi>restore</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God which they have <hi>robbed</hi> him of by Sin; they can make no <hi>Reparation</hi> for the Unrichteousnesses and indignities which they have done to him; and being such <hi>insolent Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> not able to pay what they owe, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any <hi>Surety</hi> to do it for them, they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be <hi>let out.</hi> He who cannot <hi>clear his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> with God, nor so much as <hi>begin</hi> to clear it, can find no fault with his being an <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Prisoner.</hi> After a Soul hath lain <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Ages</hi> in Hell, he hath <hi>as much</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for, as he had at his <hi>first Entrance;</hi> there is not <hi>one Line</hi> wiped out of his <hi>whole Score.</hi> The <hi>guilt</hi> of every Sin is <hi>Infinite,</hi> by Reason of the Object against whom it is committed, and this can never be expiated by the <hi>utmost Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of a <hi>Finite</hi> Creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the <hi>ƲSE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information.</hi> 1. How <hi>great</hi> must he be, who is thus <hi>able to</hi> Destroy! Surely the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God are <hi>deeper than that Hell,</hi> which he cast Sinners into. <hi>Job</hi> 11.8. what awful words are those, whereby he expresses one part of his Glorious Excellency! <hi>Deut</hi> 32.40. <hi>I lift up my Hand to Heaven, and say, I live for ever.</hi> God speaks here in the form of an <hi>Oath;</hi> and as the Angel swore after the like manner by the Life of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.5, 6. so God here swears <hi>by his own Life,</hi> to intimate what an Object of dread the <hi>Living God</hi> is to a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40872:60"/>
                  <hi>perishing Sinner;</hi> for as surely as God lives, the Sinner shall dye. How <hi>fearful a thing</hi> must it be to <hi>fall into his Hands,</hi> out of which every Criminal <hi>would fain flee,</hi> but cannot! <hi>Job</hi> 27.22. what Conceptions can we have of him, that bear a Proportion to his <hi>terrible Majesty!</hi> 2. How false and groundless is that fancy of the <hi>Expiration</hi> of a Sinner's Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Torment <hi>after a limited term!</hi> one of the <hi>Ancients</hi> dream't of a <hi>flaming River,</hi> through which all Creatures were to pass, (not onely <hi>damned Souls,</hi> but even the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves) and so to be <hi>sav'd at last.</hi> Others since his time, have started some fond Opinions of the same kind, as if <hi>Mercy</hi> would finally <hi>rejoyce against Judgment,</hi> and swallow up all in its own embraces. But the <hi>largeness</hi> of such Men's <hi>Charity</hi> outdoes the <hi>soundness</hi> of their Faith; and how reconcileable soever this may be to a <hi>soft indulgence</hi> in their own Tempers, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Scripture-Account of God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible righteousness, and the state of the World to come. <hi>Abraham</hi> was no such <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorter</hi> to the <hi>Rich Man,</hi> as to tell him, that he should or might <hi>shoot this Gulph</hi> hereafter. 3.

               <p>THE <hi>first Petition</hi> of the <hi>Rich Man</hi> which more directly and plainly concern'd <hi>himself,</hi> being rejected, and that Rejection ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified and supported by very convincing Reasons (which have been consider'd) we have here before us a <hi>second</hi> Request from the same Person, which does seemingly referr not so much to himself, now in Hell, as to <hi>those whom he left behind him</hi> upon Earth. He found he could not succeed in the other Matter, and so he tries whether he can prevail in this. <hi>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In which Request we may take Notice of five things. 1. The <hi>Messenger</hi> whom he sues for. <hi>[That thou wouldst send him]</hi> i. e. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus;</hi> the same Person whom he begg'd to have dispatch't upon the former Errand, <hi>v.</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:40872:63"/>24. How useless and burdensome soever this poor Beggar was thought to be while he liv'd, (<hi>of whom</hi> really the <hi>World was not worthy</hi>) we find, there were more <hi>good Offices</hi> than one, which he was judg'd capable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Death. So, many times a <hi>double Honour</hi> and Respect is paid to the Names and Memories of <hi>departed Saints,</hi> when Men have learnt by Experience, that the want of their Service is not to be supplied so well by any others; their Enemies very often, who have hasten'd them to their Graves, have <hi>wish'd them alive</hi> agian, and felt the need of their Assistance; as that wicked <hi>king of</hi> Israel wept over the Face of dying <hi>Elisha,</hi> 2 Kings 13.14. 2. The <hi>Place</hi> which he would have had him sent unto; <hi>[To my Fahter's House].</hi> As if he, who lay neglected at the Gate before, might Promise himself better Entertainment now; <hi>Lazarus</hi> had been trampled on and spurn'd at, as an <hi>ungrateful Spectacle,</hi> now he is invited to make a Visit, as a desirable and <hi>welcome Guest.</hi> Thus our <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> whom <hi>his own would not receive,</hi> while he went up and down among them, foretels that there would be a Time, when they should say, <hi>Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord,</hi> Matth. 23.39. 3. The <hi>Occasion</hi> of asking this; <hi>[For I have five Brethren].</hi> Whether these were strictly such as descended from the <hi>same Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> or <hi>remoter Kindred</hi> (who in Scripture are frequently stiled <hi>Brethren,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.55. and many other Places) and whether there were precisely <hi>so many</hi> of them, or only a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinite
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40872:63"/>and <hi>certain number</hi> put for an <hi>uncertain,</hi> is not material. There were some <hi>remaining Branches</hi> of a dissolute Family, that follow'd the same Course, and trod in the same Steps, as this <hi>Rich Man</hi> had done; which is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual thing in the <hi>Tents of Wickedness.</hi> When <hi>one</hi> is snatcht away, there are still <hi>others</hi> that keep up his ungodly Customs, and inherit the <hi>Vices,</hi> as well as <hi>Estate</hi> of their wretched <hi>Predecessor;</hi> as is said, <hi>Psalm</hi> 49.13. <hi>This their Way is their Folly, yet their Posterity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Sayings.</hi> 4. The <hi>Message</hi> which he would have him deliver <hi>[That he may te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie to them]</hi> 'tis implyed, what the <hi>Matter</hi> of his Testimony should be; <hi>viz.</hi> The Evil and Danger of <hi>their present Practice,</hi> backt with an Account of what the <hi>Rich Man</hi> himself was now <hi>actually endaring</hi> for those very Sins in which they yet liv'd. <hi>Q. d.</hi>
                  <q>Let <hi>Lazarus</hi> be a <hi>Preacher of Righteousness</hi> to that lewd Generation whom I am taken from; let him tell them that which he knows of what I feel, and represent my woful and distressed Case with all those Circumstances of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which such an <hi>Eye-witness</hi> is better able to describe than another Person.</q> 5. The <hi>End</hi> for which he desir'd it; <hi>[Lest they also come into this Place of Torment].</hi> He knew that his <hi>Brethren must</hi> come thither as surely as himself, if they went on in the same Road, and therefore he sought to have this <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Means</hi> applied for Prevention. He reckoned, that while they were <hi>joyned to the Living,</hi> there might be <hi>Hope</hi> concerning them;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40872:64"/>if they were brought to <hi>Repentance,</hi> they might escape his Doom; and this was what he aimed at in the preferring of his Petition on their behalf. But here the difficulty lyes, how this must be understood; whether the <hi>Rich Man</hi> had not really more respect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, than his five Brethren, and whether he askt not this singular Favour rather for <hi>his own sake,</hi> than <hi>theirs,</hi> who were still alive. For, 1. It is most undoubted, that there is no real <hi>Charity</hi> among the Damned to the Souls of their Survivers, nor any true, <hi>Zeal</hi> for their Salvation; they that have finally lost their own Souls, are not sincerely sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about the welfare of other Men's. Can any such <hi>good thing</hi> be found in Hell, which is the very <hi>Sink</hi> and <hi>Center</hi> of all Manner of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? No certainly. 2. It is possible indeed, (as some have thought) that there may be common <hi>Remnants of Humanity</hi> in the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Nature, and that these may produce a few workings of Affection and Compassion towards those that have been dear to them, if they be likely to suffer with them. But however, 3. It is most probable, that the <hi>main Reason</hi> which swayed the Rich Man to the making of this Request, was the fear of the <hi>Aggravation of his own Torments,</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Sin and future Damnation of his now living Brethren; he expected to fare the <hi>worse,</hi> and suffer the <hi>more</hi> by their Means, if they were not reclaim'd. So that whatever design was pretended or appear'd at the first sight, this regard to <hi>Self</hi> was at the Bottom.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To shew in General, that the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Damned is cvapable of <hi>Addition;</hi> that their Torments may be <hi>increas'd</hi> in the Place of Torment; their Furnace made <hi>hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and their Flame <hi>more vehement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Devils</hi> are already <hi>tormented,</hi> and yet are in Expectation of <hi>further Torment.</hi> As is intimated by that Question of the <hi>Ʋnclean Spirits</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> Mat. 8.29. <hi>Art thou come to Torment us before the Time?</hi> Not that they are now <hi>at ease,</hi> (for they are said to <hi>seek rest and find none,</hi> c. 12.43.) But there is a <hi>set Time</hi> which they look for, when they shall be <hi>more uneasie,</hi> than they now are. Tho now they are under actual <hi>Execution,</hi> yet still they are kept to be brought forth to a Day of <hi>greater Wrath.</hi> Hence they are said to <hi>tremble,</hi> Jam. 2.19. which Springs from their fore-knowledge of some <hi>Evil to come</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined against them, and hitherto not infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. By partity of Reason, we may also conclude, that they who have their miserable
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40872:65"/>
                  <hi>Portion with</hi> Devils, do not receive all that Portion <hi>at once;</hi> but <hi>new Scenes</hi> of Vengeance may present themselves one after another, and the <hi>floods</hi> of Divine Wrath in that <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless Pit</hi> where they are cast, may (like the <hi>Waters of the Sanctuary</hi>) rise still <hi>higher and higher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Plagues</hi> which are <hi>laid up in store</hi> with God, are not to be <hi>exhausted.</hi> Tho the Souls in Hell may truly say, that God hath <hi>set them up for his Mark,</hi> and he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>spending his Arrows upon them,</hi> yet his <hi>Quiver</hi> is always <hi>full.</hi> It can never be said, that He hath <hi>gone to the utmost</hi> in punishing, so that he can go no further. How often is that Threatening repeated, in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. <hi>I will punish you yet seven times more! Seven</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken as a number of <hi>Perfection,</hi> and so used in the Scripture; and therefore new <hi>Degrees</hi> (if not <hi>Kings</hi>) of Punishment may be executed everlastingly. Unless a Man could <hi>see to the End</hi> of Infinite Displeasure, He can never tell when he <hi>is</hi> as miserable as he <hi>can be.</hi> In this Senc e, God's Judgments are a <hi>great Deep,</hi> and he hath <hi>fresh Vials</hi> to pour out continually. It is the promised Happiness of Saints, that the <hi>Lamb shall lead them to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fountains,</hi> Rev. 7.17. Rewarding Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and revenging Justice, make their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Distributions from a <hi>boundless Stock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>new Sins</hi> which are committed <hi>in Hell</hi> it self, call for an Addition to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Misery. As they who are in a state of endless Rewards, are <hi>still serving</hi> of God, so
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40872:65"/>they who are in a state of Punishment, are still <hi>sinning</hi> against him; they do not only <hi>not repent</hi> of their <hi>old sins,</hi> but they <hi>go on, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> new ones every Moment. And is it to be suppos'd, that these Sins should escape <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punisht,</hi> or that the Punishment of such new Sins must be <hi>included</hi> in the Punishment of the old ones? Why should not the same Hell have an <hi>Accession of Heat,</hi> as the same Soul <hi>burns</hi> with greater Rage and Fury against God? What Reason is there, that their Misery should be <hi>at a stay,</hi> when their Wickedness is <hi>increasing?</hi> Justice seems to require, that their <hi>Sorrows should be multiplied</hi> in Proportion to their Sins; on the same account, that they who are <hi>greater Sinners,</hi> receive <hi>greater Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> than the rest. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. It will be <hi>more tolerable</hi> for some than others, (tho po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively intolerable for all) and so it may be more tolerable at the <hi>beginning</hi> of their Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than in the <hi>progress</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How <hi>sinful Relatives</hi> and <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> particulrly add to the Misery of the Damned. <hi>Ans.</hi> Two ways; by their <hi>Sins</hi> while they live, and by their <hi>Society</hi> when they dye.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Misery of the Damned is augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Sins</hi> of their Relatives and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions while they <hi>live.</hi> Tho they that are in Hell, be <hi>ignorant</hi> of what is done on Earth, and cannot <hi>now</hi> be <hi>accessory</hi> to it, yet we are to consider what they have contributed to it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40872:66"/>
                  <hi>heretofore,</hi> and how thereby they may be yet <hi>Partakers of other Men's</hi> present <hi>Sins.</hi> Tho <hi>they</hi> be now separated from them in <hi>another</hi> World, the pernicious <hi>influence</hi> of what they did in <hi>this,</hi> may still continue. And so God justly visits the Sins of the <hi>Living</hi> upon the <hi>Dead;</hi> for he is said to <hi>give to every one,</hi> not only <hi>according to his Ways,</hi> but <hi>according to the Fruit of his Doings,</hi> Jer. 32.19. The <hi>Fruit</hi> of our Doings may appear a long time after we are <hi>gather'd to our Fathers;</hi> Men may <hi>sow those poysonous Seeds</hi> now, which will <hi>spring up and bring forth</hi> many Years hence, when they are <hi>dwelling in the Dust.</hi> The Sins of those that out-live us, may be in great measure the <hi>Effects</hi> of ours, and therefore we may be made to suffer <hi>for</hi> them. Particularly</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The Sins of Survivers may be very much owing to the former <hi>Perswasions and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which they had from those that are gone before them. <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the Ten Tribes to him, sets up two Golden Calves, one in <hi>Dan,</hi> the other in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> and the People were quickly induced to go and worship before them, and this <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> lasted so long after his <hi>Decease,</hi> (even till they were carried Captive by the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.22, 23.) that the Holy Ghost seldom mentions his Name, without this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Addition, <hi>who made</hi> Israel <hi>to Sin.</hi> Corrupt Nature leads Men to <hi>walk in the Counsel of the Ʋngodly,</hi> when the <hi>Counsellours</hi> themselves are <hi>perished;</hi> now tho they that follow the wicked Suggestions of others shall
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40872:66"/>
                  <hi>bear their own Burden,</hi> yet there is a guilt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived upon the <hi>Tempters</hi> too. Lustful <hi>Amnon</hi> suffers for the debauching of his innocent Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, but subtil <hi>Jonadab</hi> bears <hi>his Iniquity</hi> also for prompting and advising him to it; and was his <hi>own Enemy</hi> in being <hi>such a Friend</hi> of that wanton Prince, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.3. So, tho <hi>Ahab</hi> be mark't out as a <hi>Monster</hi> in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet 'tis also mention'd, that <hi>Jezebel his WIfe stirr'd him up,</hi> 1 Kings 21.25. The oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner any Souls are taken in <hi>Snares</hi> which we <hi>have laid,</hi> the worse it will be for us.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Survivers Sin many times by the <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of their sinful Predecessors. A wicked Man, while he Lives, does often help to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish others with <hi>fewel</hi> for those Lusts, which are not <hi>extinct</hi> so soon as he. The giving of <hi>large Estates</hi> to dissolute young <hi>Prodigals,</hi> that have no Sense of Religion, nor common So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety to govern them, is putting of a <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon</hi> into their Hands, wherewith they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>fight against God.</hi> The Devil could not have had so much <hi>Service</hi> from such Persons, if they had not been supplied with <hi>materials to Work upon.</hi> This will turn to a <hi>sad account,</hi> not only to themselves, but to those that were the <hi>Dispensers</hi> of this abused Substance. It is a dreadful thing to be charged with the <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> and supporting of the Wickedness of those that live after us, and stand up in our Room; when it may be said, that this or that <hi>Abomination</hi> had never been committed, if we had not <hi>provided the Means</hi> whereby to bring it forth.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:40872:67"/> (3.) Survivers Sin oftentimes after the <hi>ill Examples</hi> of those whom they succeed. <hi>We will do</hi> (cry the rebellious <hi>Jews</hi>) <hi>as we have done, we and our Fathers,</hi> Jerem. 44.17. Their <hi>Fathers</hi> were then Dead, but their <hi>bad Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> (it seems) were of force still; the <hi>foul Copy</hi> which they <hi>set,</hi> was eagerly <hi>transcrib'd</hi> by those that sprung out of their Loins. Such <hi>Imitations</hi> are very natural; if we have seen others <hi>driving</hi> towards Hell, who are now arriv'd at that miserable Stage, we have a strong <hi>byass</hi> within us which <hi>draws</hi> us the same way. But <hi>wo to them by whom</hi> this Evil <hi>comes;</hi> they who are the <hi>Originals</hi> of it, will suffer the more <hi>for their sakes</hi> whom their wretched Pattern hath <hi>misled.</hi> There have been Multitudes in the World, that have not only <hi>fallen by their own Iniquity,</hi> but have <hi>sunk the deeper</hi> into Hell, by others <hi>falling upon them,</hi> to whom their Iniquity hath been a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>stumbling Block.</hi> The more a Sinner's <hi>ways are learn't,</hi> the more his Punishment is height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Misery of the Damned is increas'd by the <hi>Society</hi> of their Relatives and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when they <hi>dye.</hi> This will appear, if we consider these three things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) If there be any <hi>Impressions of Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and Kindness left in Damned Souls, the <hi>Misery of those</hi> that have been dear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to them, will aggravate <hi>their own.</hi> Whatever Pleasure some <hi>Devilish</hi> Minds may
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40872:67"/>take in the Ruine of those whom they <hi>hate,</hi> yet the Destruction of those whom they <hi>Love,</hi> will be tormenting. To see the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of any Persons, whom our Affections are peculiarly set upon, is a <hi>wounding Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;</hi> to have the <hi>desire of our Eyes</hi> put upon the Rack <hi>before our Eyes,</hi> is enough to <hi>cut us to the Heart;</hi> as the <hi>Sons of</hi> Zedekiah were <hi>slain</hi> in his sight, before they <hi>put out his Eyes,</hi> 2 Kings 25.7. <hi>David</hi> tells <hi>Hushai</hi> for this Reason, when he was flying from <hi>Absolom,</hi> that <hi>if he passed on with him, he would bea bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to him,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.33. That Company which otherwise would be the greatest <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> adds to our <hi>Affliction,</hi> when they are made to <hi>suffer with us.</hi> They must be very unnaturally <hi>barbarous,</hi> who should chuse to have their dearest Friends <hi>involved</hi> in the same Punishment with them, rather than <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted</hi> from it. It argues <hi>utmost Cruelty</hi> of Spirit, to be <hi>eased</hi> by others <hi>partaking</hi> in our Miseries.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>sight</hi> of those whom they have <hi>sinned with,</hi> is a <hi>fresh revival</hi> of their own Guilt; like the <hi>casting of the Carkasses</hi> of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters <hi>upon the Carkasses of their Idols;</hi> as is threaten'd, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.30. The most <hi>dreadful Objects</hi> to an awakened Sinner here in <hi>this</hi> World, are such as have been the <hi>beloved Partners</hi> of his former Wickedness; but it is much more so in the <hi>next</hi> World. When <hi>Amnon</hi> had satisfied his Lust upon his Sister <hi>tamar,</hi> he could not endure her any longer in his <hi>Presence;</hi> he that was so <hi>Sick</hi> for her
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40872:68"/>before, that he could not live without her, was now as hasty in <hi>sending her away,</hi> 2 Sam. 13.17. <hi>Put now this Woman out from me, and bolt the Door after her.</hi> He refuses to call her Sister, but with a kind of Disdain and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, <hi>this Woman;</hi> and she must be put out <hi>now,</hi> instantly, without any delay; and the Door must be <hi>bolted</hi> after her, as if he were resolv'd to see her no more. Tho the Sins of the Damned are <hi>ever before them,</hi> and 'tis impossible that they should forget them, yet it would be a kind of <hi>Negative Comfort,</hi> to have all that joyned with them in those Sins, <hi>buried out of their view.</hi> Their unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perpetual Converse with <hi>such,</hi> is as bad as their <hi>fellowship with Devils</hi> themselves; for hereby all the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of their past pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate Lives will be every moment plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It is not to be doubted, but that when <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Fellow-workers, in Iniquity</hi> meet in Hell, they will be always sharply <hi>upbraiding and reviling</hi> one another. They will not only <hi>curse God</hi> for preserving them in being, yea and for bringing them into being, but more justly and deservedly Curse those also, who have been any way the <hi>Instruments</hi> and <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of bringing them to that Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As <hi>Joab</hi> once cahrged <hi>David</hi> with <hi>loving his Enemies, and hating his Friends,</hi> 2 Sam. 19.6. So it may be truly said of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory Sinners, while they are on this side of Hell; they are <hi>angry</hi> with those that would <hi>divert</hi> them from their Evil way, and <hi>pleas'd</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:40872:68"/>with such as <hi>promote</hi> them in it; which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to do, what <hi>David</hi> was accus'd of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But hereafter their Note will be chang'd; they will most <hi>bitterly exclaim</hi> against those very Persons, of whom they are now most <hi>passionately fond;</hi> they will cry out of them as the <hi>Murderers of their Souls,</hi> who have been the <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Abettors of their Sins;</hi> and these <hi>mutual</hi> Reproaches and Invectives will be the dismal Employment of their Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thridly,</hi> Why shall the Misery of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned be aggravated after this Manner. I will only propose these two <hi>Reasons</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because God does in Infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten chuse to <hi>punish</hi> Men in that wherein they do <hi>offend;</hi> so as to punish them not only <hi>for</hi> their evil Works, but <hi>by</hi> them. It tends most remarkably to the Glory of God's <hi>Justice,</hi> when the <hi>Rod of the Wicked</hi> is made their <hi>own Scourge,</hi> and their Plagues <hi>grow out of</hi> their Provocations. As <hi>David</hi>'s sinful <hi>Indulgence</hi> to <hi>Absolom</hi> and <hi>Adonijah</hi> was punisht in their <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Ʋsurpation;</hi> He <hi>let loose the Reins</hi> to them, and for a requital, they would have <hi>run away with his Crown;</hi> so here, Wicked Men by the <hi>Propagaation of Sin,</hi> do also propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate <hi>their own Misery;</hi> they turn <hi>Corrupters</hi> of others, and God makes them suffer by those whom they have <hi>corrupted.</hi> The Evil which they spread, <hi>recoils</hi> upon themselves; as a <hi>Candle</hi> that <hi>sets Fire</hi> to all heap of combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40872:69"/>Matter round about it, is the sooner <hi>mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> in a Flame of its <hi>own kindling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. God chuses likewise oftentimes to <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Men in that wherein they most <hi>delight.</hi> He is never more magnified, nor the Sinner more confounded, than when the Sinner's <hi>chiefest Joy</hi> is turn'd into his <hi>greatest Sorrow.</hi> Licentious Company is the carnal Man's <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this World,</hi> and yet the same Company will be an ungrateful Ingredient of his <hi>Future Hell.</hi> They that <hi>live without God,</hi> never think themselves so <hi>Happy,</hi> as when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with those who are like themselves; and hereafter this very thing will render them the more extreamly <hi>miserable.</hi> So it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens in the Course of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence here, that a Man's <hi>mistaken Comforts</hi> prove his <hi>real Crosses;</hi> and what he once em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd with greatest <hi>cagerness,</hi> he afterwards unwillingly possesses with greatest <hi>Vexation.</hi> As <hi>Judas</hi> threw down the thirty <hi>Pieces</hi> in a rage, which he so greedily coveted before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the <hi>ƲSE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information.</hi> 1. No <hi>solitude</hi> upon Earth so sad, as the <hi>Society</hi> which is in Hell. The <hi>Wo of being alone,</hi> is a Mercy and a <hi>Priviledge,</hi> in Comparison of their more wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation there. Retirement and Separation from a Man's pleasant Companions in accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very <hi>grievous</hi> now, whereas hereafter it would be truly <hi>desirable.</hi> What <hi>Job</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40872:69"/>of, <hi>c.</hi> 19.13. The Damned Soul might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thankful for; if God would <hi>put his Brethren and Acquaintants far from him.</hi> It would be better to take an <hi>Everlasting Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> of them at Death, than to <hi>behold them any more</hi> after it. He that <hi>wanders in Desarts and Mountains,</hi> lives in <hi>Paradise,</hi> to him that is under the necessity of renewing such afflictive Converse. 2. No Company can be an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to Sin,</hi> which is an <hi>Addition</hi> rather than <hi>Abatement of Suffering.</hi> How unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>to follow a Multitude in doing Evil,</hi> Exod. 23.2. When <hi>Multitude</hi> will not help us in the <hi>bearing of Evil,</hi> but the contrary! <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> to others in their wicked Practises is no more an <hi>excuse,</hi> than <hi>Communion</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their Punishment is a <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> To Plead our going along with the <hi>Stream</hi> or <hi>Crowd</hi> of those whom we know and have most Temptation to be influenc'd by, will not <hi>cover our Guilt;</hi> and to be turned into Hell among such at last, will not procure us any <hi>Contentment,</hi> but increase our <hi>Impatience.</hi> that should not be a Motive to <hi>allure,</hi> which will be a means of <hi>Trouble.</hi> 3. The <hi>Blood of Souls</hi> is an <hi>heavy Burden;</hi> and 'tis every one's great concern to <hi>keep himself pure</hi> from it; for we see, even the Damned would <hi>heave it off,</hi> if they could. It is a doleful thing, to have the <hi>Temporal Death</hi> of any other Person lying at our Door; the <hi>old Prophet</hi> at <hi>Bethel</hi> who had seduced the <hi>Man of God,</hi> and was made to pronounce the sad Sentence against him
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40872:70"/>for his Compliance, 1 Kings 13.21, 22. mourned over his <hi>torn Carkass</hi> with a <hi>bleeding Heart,</hi> v. 29, 30. Because he had by his false Insinuations brought him to that unhappy and untimely End. But what is the <hi>Body</hi> to the <hi>Soul,</hi> or a <hi>Mortal Life</hi> to <hi>Immortality? Spirutal Blood-guiltiness</hi> is of a much <hi>deeper Dye;</hi> which we need to pray more earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and endeavour more carefully, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. Look to the <hi>Piety</hi> and Religion of <hi>your Families,</hi> as well as <hi>Personal Holiness;</hi> that they may be <hi>Fellow-heirs</hi> with you, and <hi>Partakers of the same Grace.</hi> Let every one execute <hi>Joshua</hi>'s Resolution as far as is possible; <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>As for me, and my House, we will serve the Lord.</hi> It was a very commendable thing in the <hi>two Tribes and half,</hi> when they built the <hi>ALtar of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that <hi>theri Children in afgter times might not be made to cease from fearing the Lord,</hi> c. 22.25. Where <hi>Age</hi> gives a <hi>preheminence,</hi> improve it for God, and not for the Devil; like <hi>Lot's eldest Daughter,</hi> who was the <hi>Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader</hi> in that abominable <hi>Incest,</hi> to her <hi>Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sister,</hi> Gen. 19.31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Cut off all the occasions of Sin</hi> from <hi>others</hi> as well as <hi>your selves,</hi> as much as you can. Take heed of doing any thing, which may probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (like <hi>Gideon's Ephod,</hi> Judg. 8.27) <hi>a snare to you,</hi> or to <hi>your House.</hi> There is one thing especially very pernicious, which they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40872:70"/>that <hi>profess a Subjection to the Gospel,</hi> are too little scrupulous of; viz. <hi>unequal Yoking</hi> with those that believe not. The sinful <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages</hi> of HOly and Prophane Persons are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times punisht in the Wickedness of their <hi>Posterity.</hi> The Son of the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whose Father was an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> prov'd a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> Levit. 24.10, 11. <hi>Solomon</hi> had but <hi>one Son</hi> by his vast number of Wives and Conc ubines, and that one descending partly from an <hi>accursed People,</hi> was too like unto them; It is twice mention'd that <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s Mother, was <hi>Naamah, an Ammonitess,</hi> 1 Kings 14.21, 31. 3. <hi>Suppress</hi> the Sins which you cannot <hi>prevent,</hi> to your very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost. Ungodly <hi>Secrets</hi> are not to be <hi>kept,</hi> out of a foolish tenderness, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and impartially <hi>reveal'd.</hi> It is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Honour, that he <hi>brought to his Father the Evil report</hi> of his lewd Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.2. The nearest Relations were <hi>not to be pitied,</hi> nor <hi>spar'd,</hi> nor <hi>conceal'd</hi> in the Case of Enticement to Idolatry, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Inferiors</hi> must <hi>discover</hi> Sin, and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors</hi> ought to <hi>punish</hi> it. <hi>Eli</hi>'s <hi>House</hi> was to be <hi>judg'd for ever, because his Sons made themselves Vile, and he restrained them not,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.13. His Power was great, not only as a <hi>Parent,</hi> but a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and their Facts notorious; he <hi>heard of them from all the People,</hi> c. 2.23. Yet he did but <hi>soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuke,</hi> what he should have <hi>severely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</hi> Let us therefore discharge our
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40872:71"/>Consciences towards all under our Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Influence, that if they do perish, we may be <hi>guiltless;</hi> and then, tho their <hi>feared</hi> Misery be our <hi>Affliction</hi> now, their <hi>actual</hi> Misery will not lessen our <hi>Happiness</hi> at last.</p>

                  <hi>and the Prophets</hi>]. These two <hi>Moses and the Prophets,</hi> are frequently put together, as comprehensive of the whole <hi>Old Testament, John</hi> 1.45. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. Or (which is the same thing) the <hi>Law and the Prophets,</hi> as it is exprest in other Places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. <hi>c.</hi> 22.40. The one being the <hi>beginning,</hi> and the other the <hi>end</hi> of that sacred Volume, which take in all the rest between them. But how could it be said, that they <hi>had Moses</hi> and the Prophets, whereas they were Dead so long before their Time? <hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) They had their <hi>Writings,</hi> which supplied the Place and Room of their <hi>Persons.</hi> The same God who <hi>spake</hi> originally <hi>to Moses Face to Face,</hi> Exod. 33.11. And <hi>by the Mouth of his Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> Luke 1.70. Did also <hi>guide the Pens</hi> of those who Recorded what was spoken; so that <hi>all Scripture</hi> is truly said to be <hi>given by Divine Inspiration,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. The Word <hi>Written</hi> is equivalent with the Word <hi>spoken;</hi> and being written by the Direction and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God himself, is <hi>as much to be believ'd,</hi> as if the first Speakers of it from God were now alive. (2.) They had these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <hi>publickly Read and Expounded</hi> to them. The <hi>Prophets were read every Sabbath-day,</hi> Acts 13.27. And so was <hi>Moses read in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues in every City,</hi> c. 15.21. Which read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was also accompanied with some Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; (as indeed it seems reasonable that it should be) for after the return from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, they are said to <hi>give the sence,</hi> Neh. 8.8. And on this account the People are
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40872:73"/>bidden to <hi>seek the Law at the Priest's Mouth,</hi> Mal. 2.7. The Priests being by their Office (when duely Executed) the <hi>Living Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the <hi>Deceased Holy Writers.</hi> So that God having provided such a <hi>Compensation</hi> for the Deaths of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, they might be said to enjoy them still. 2. They <hi>Improvement</hi> required. <hi>[Let them hear them]</hi> This is not to be understood as a bare <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> of what they <hi>might</hi> do, but as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> signifying what they <hi>ought</hi> to do; as they had the <hi>Opportunity</hi> of hearing, so they were <hi>oblig'd</hi> to lay hold of it. But is it not to be rationally supposed, that these <hi>Brethren</hi> of the <hi>Rich Man</hi> did <hi>hear</hi> Moses and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as they were Men of <hi>Israel,</hi> and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the <hi>Jewish Religion,</hi> and consequently frequenters of the <hi>Publick Worship;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why should <hi>Abraham</hi> urge the doing of that which was already done? <hi>Ans.</hi> So did <hi>David</hi> undoubtedly, during his <hi>Impenitence</hi> for those hainous Sins of Adultery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, go to the service of the Tabernacle, and the hearing of the Law, but he heard to no purpose all that Time. The meer <hi>hearing of the Ear</hi> is not enough, as is plain from Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 26. <hi>James.</hi> 1. 22. And therefore <hi>such</hi> Hearing cannot be all that is intended; but hearing so as to <hi>come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and bring forth answerable Fruits; to <hi>receive Instruction,</hi> in order to Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to <hi>hear and he wise, and guide our Hearts in the Way,</hi> as <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.19. to hear and yeild Obedience, or else we do but <hi>offer the Sacrifice of Fools,</hi> Eccl. 5.1.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To shew, that the <hi>having</hi> of the Word with us, is indeed a <hi>special Priviledge.</hi> This is easily prov'd, if we seriously consider these four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are <hi>Multitudes</hi> in the World, that <hi>have it not,</hi> to whom it might have been sent, as well as unto <hi>us,</hi> if it had pleased God to Order it so. As the <hi>Jews</hi> of old were favour'd in this respect <hi>above all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Earth</hi> besides, so it is now with the <hi>Christian World,</hi> and with <hi>this Part</hi> of it above many others. Whether we compare our selves with the <hi>Heathen,</hi> or <hi>Antichristian</hi> World, we cannot but perceive, that we are highly priviledg'd. 1. With the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> World; who tho they have something of the <hi>Law written on their Hearts</hi> (enough to leave them <hi>without Excuse</hi> in the transgressing of what they know) yet it is so wofully
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40872:74"/>
                  <hi>blotted</hi> and deprav'd, so broken and defective at the best, that they may be said to know nothing in Comparison of us. A <hi>Candle</hi> is not so much inferior to the <hi>Sun,</hi> as the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> shining in its greatest clearness, comes short of <hi>Scripture.</hi> We therefore, who are <hi>called out of that Darkness</hi> in which they <hi>sit,</hi> reap a vast Advantage which they want, in having the <hi>Oracles of God committed to us.</hi> 2. With the <hi>Antichristian</hi> World, whose wretched Inhabitants are restrained from <hi>opening this Book</hi> or <hi>looking therein.</hi> It is <hi>sealed up</hi> from them in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> and even in that Tongue <hi>falsified by a very corrupt Translation.</hi> They are forbidden to meddle with this <hi>Tree of Knowledge</hi> of which we may <hi>eat;</hi> and what <hi>Fruit</hi> their deluding <hi>Teachers</hi> pretend to <hi>gather from it,</hi> is <hi>poyson'd</hi> with abominable mixtures before it comes to their Hands. A free and <hi>unlimited Ʋse</hi> of our <hi>Bibles</hi> is our Glory, as <hi>Protestants;</hi> and on the other side, that which is commonly learnt by <hi>Popish Sermons,</hi> needs to be unlearn't, and <hi>pull'd down</hi> again, by them that would be <hi>built up to the heavenly Inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They that have not the Word, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of that which in God's <hi>usual and stated Course</hi> is <hi>requisite to Salvation.</hi> What strange and <hi>secret Ways</hi> God may possibly have in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving some <hi>without the Word,</hi> I think, no Man is able to assign; we are to judge by what he hath <hi>reveal'd;</hi> and if we go by that Rule, we shall find that <hi>Faith</hi> it self is not more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to <hi>Salation,</hi> than <hi>Hearing</hi> is to <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:40872:75"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. Tho all have not Faith, that hear the Word, yet <hi>how shall they believe that hear it not?</hi> 'Tis a Question which the Holy Ghost puts, and he who thinks he can answer it, may do well to <hi>try the Spirit,</hi> which he is led by. The Scripture still speaks of the great Work of Faith, as the Effect of this <hi>instrumental</hi> Cause, under the influence of the <hi>Supream,</hi> Acts 4.4. <hi>Many of them which heard the Word, believed.</hi> So <hi>c.</hi> 18.8. <hi>Many of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>hearing, believed.</hi> It does not therefore appear, from what God hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd of his Mind and Will to us, but that they to whom the Word comes not, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and perish in their <hi>Insidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>taking away</hi> of the Word from those that have <hi>enjoy'd</hi> it, is threaten'd by God, as a <hi>peouliar Judgment,</hi> and should be so resented by us, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. <hi>Behold the Days come, saith the Ford, that I will send not a Famine of Bread, but</hi> (what is a great deal <hi>worse,</hi> for that is manifestly implied in the manner of Expression) <hi>a Famine of hearing the Words of the Lord.</hi> A <hi>Famine of Bread</hi> is no small Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; (it exceeds the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.13. And the <hi>Sword,</hi> Lam. 4.9. Which yet are two dreadful Evils) but this <hi>Famine of the Word</hi> is abundantly greater. It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to part with the <hi>Staff of Life,</hi> than the <hi>Food of Souls.</hi> This was the fearful threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the <hi>Church of</hi> Ephesus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. <hi>I will remove thy Candlestick out of its Place.</hi> The <hi>Candlestick</hi> signifies nothing, if the <hi>Light</hi> be gone; so without the Continuance of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40872:75"/>
                  <hi>Word,</hi> there must be the Dissolution of a <hi>Church-state.</hi> Now if the Judgment of <hi>losing</hi> the Gospel be so great, the Priviledge of <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> it is proportionable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many that <hi>have had</hi> the Word, wanted this <hi>last and compleat Edition</hi> of it, which was reserv'd to these <hi>New Testament</hi> Times. We have not only <hi>Moses and the Prophets</hi> (as they in the Text had) but <hi>Jesus Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</hi> God hath added considerably to the <hi>Church's Teasure,</hi> since our Lord Jesus came to <hi>manifest his Father's Name,</hi> and <hi>bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Truth</hi> in his own Person. Even they whose <hi>inspired Writings</hi> make up a Part of what we now possess, had not those <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Divine Revelation,</hi> which we have, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Many Prophets and Righteous Men have dosired to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.</hi> They who gave the first Intimations of Christ's coming into the World, would have been glad to know, what the <hi>Evangelists</hi> reported concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, after he was come. The <hi>Word of the Kingdom</hi> (as well as the <hi>Kingdom</hi> it self) was formerly contain'd in a <hi>lesser Compass,</hi> and that which was, was deliver'd more <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely;</hi> now we have such <hi>Enlargements,</hi> as do both perfect and <hi>clear</hi> up the whole. So that if the <hi>Israelites</hi> heretofore were honour'd with <hi>knowing the joyful Sound</hi> more than any Nation in the World, <hi>we</hi> evidently go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, and are dignified <hi>even in this</hi> much more than they.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:40872:76"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Wherein does the Priviledge of having the <hi>Word lye? Ans.</hi> We may take it in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have <hi>God speaking</hi> in the Word. It is truly the <hi>Voice of God, and not of Man;</hi> and they that do not apprehend it so, mistake it, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did when the <hi>Lord called him</hi> three times successively, and he still thought that it was <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.8. He that heareth those which are sent of God, <hi>heareth him in hearing them,</hi> Luke 10.16. For (as <hi>Christ</hi> himself said) <hi>their Word is not theirs, but his,</hi> John 14.24. The <hi>Audience</hi> which Christ's Ministers demand and expect, is not upon their own account, but because of him in whose <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> they come; as the <hi>Prophet</hi> said to the People of the <hi>Jews, Hear ye, and give Ear, for the Lord hath spoken,</hi> Jerem. 13.15. <hi>q. d.</hi> Yon may more safely despise a Man, than be deaf to God. Such as will not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the <hi>Men of God,</hi> declare plainly, that they <hi>will not hearken to God himself,</hi> Ezek. 3.7. For they are so far in the Place of God, as <hi>Embassadors</hi> that represent the <hi>Prince</hi> whom they come from, and follow the Orders which they have receiv'd, and deliver the Messages wherewith they are entrusted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have God speaking <hi>by Men like our selves; of the same Passions with us,</hi> Acts 14.15. This does not <hi>lesson</hi> our Priviledge, but <hi>beighten</hi> it. We cannot bear the <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> Manifestations of God, while we are in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40872:76"/>this World; as we are not able to <hi>see 'his Face and live,</hi> so if we were <hi>to hear his Voice,</hi> we <hi>should dye,</hi> Deut. 5.25. The <hi>Disciples</hi> in the Mount of <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> when the <hi>Voice came out of the Cloud,</hi> were not so much <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,</hi> as <hi>amaz'd,</hi> Mat. 17.6. It is God's gracious Condescension to our present weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that he utters his Mind to us by those who are <hi>compassed with Infirmity,</hi> as well as our selves; as <hi>Elihu</hi> said to <hi>Job; Behold I am according to thy wish, in God's stead, I also am formed out of the Clay; my Terror shall not make thee afraid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 33.6, 7. If this <hi>Treasure</hi> were not convey'd through <hi>earthen Vessels,</hi> it would be more <hi>unprofitable</hi> for us than it is. A <hi>Word spoken by Angels</hi> would not do us so much good, as that wherein God employs the <hi>Tongues of Men;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Angel</hi> that appeared to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> said little himself, but referr'd him to <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 10.6. <hi>He shall tell thee, what thou oughtest to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What an <hi>important Duty</hi> the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word is. There are four Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations which will fully make out this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> does ordinarily <hi>work most</hi> in Hearing. It is no wonder that what is by Divine <hi>Appointment,</hi> should be chiefly bless't to the <hi>Galatians by the hearing of</hi> (the Word of) <hi>Faith,</hi> and so they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd</hi> him, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> makes his appeal to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40872:77"/>them in the Case, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2, 5. As the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency</hi> of the Word, is <hi>only</hi> when it <hi>comes in the Holy Ghost,</hi> so the great <hi>operations</hi> of the Holy Ghost, are <hi>mostly,</hi> when he comes in the Word. This is the <hi>Chariot</hi> which he Rides in, when he makes his <hi>Entrance</hi> into the Soul. The <hi>Signal</hi> given to <hi>David</hi> to bestir himself against the Host of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> was when he <hi>heard the sound of a going in the Tops of the Mulberry-trees,</hi> for then would the <hi>Lord go out before him,</hi> 2 Sam. 5.24. So when we <hi>feel the Motions</hi> of the Spirit in the Preaching the Gospel, that is the time, wherein the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of our Souls are to be <hi>subdued</hi> to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a Duty which <hi>Life depends upon.</hi> We are bidden to Hear for our very Lives, <hi>Isd.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Hear and your Soul shall live.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we do <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> in this Case, we prosper or miscarr to Eternity. They that make the best Improvement of such valuable Helps, have the <hi>principal Reward,</hi> they that neglect and contemn them, have the <hi>highest Punishment.</hi> Therefore <hi>Tribulation and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, Indignation and Wrath</hi> on the one Hand, and so <hi>Glory, Honour and Peace</hi> on the other Hand, are said to be <hi>to the Jew first,</hi> Rom. 2.9, 10. The <hi>Place</hi> of Hearing, is like the <hi>Mount of Blessing</hi> and <hi>Cursing</hi> too, <hi>Gerizim</hi> and <hi>Ebal</hi> united. They that <hi>take heed how they Hear,</hi> shall <hi>inberit the Blessing</hi> to which they are called, and they that do not, are <hi>smitten with a Curse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. No <hi>Audience</hi> or success can be expected at the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> without a due <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:40872:77"/>to the <hi>Word of Grace.</hi> We cannot <hi>pray in Faith,</hi> or with acceptance, if we sleight the Ordinance of <hi>Preaching.</hi> 'Tis but just, that we should look for the <hi>same measure which we mete;</hi> but whether we look for it or not, we shall find it so. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9. <hi>He that turneth away his Ear from hearing the Law, even his Prayer shall be Abomination.</hi> If we be not <hi>sift to Hear,</hi> how can we ask of God to <hi>hear us speedily</hi> in the most urgent distressed Cases? What <hi>Confidence</hi> can we have in <hi>making known any request</hi> to him, when we have little or no regard to what he says to us? God's Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers might Preface all their Discourses, as <hi>Jotham</hi> did his <hi>Parable.</hi> Judg. 9.7. <hi>Hearken to me, that God many hearken to you,</hi> It is vain Presumption to think that our <hi>Prayers should be receiv'd,</hi> when God's <hi>calls are refus'd,</hi> or that <hi>his Ears</hi> should be <hi>open,</hi> when we <hi>stop our own.</hi> See <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>From</hi> our hearing of the Word, we may gather a certain <hi>Evidence of our State.</hi> It is made a <hi>distinguishing Character</hi> and Mark, whereby to <hi>discern between</hi> the Righteous and Wicked, the Children of God, and of the Devil. <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that is of God, heareth God's Words; you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.</hi> The <hi>Proposition</hi> which is here laid down, and the <hi>Inference</hi> which is drawn from it, do both teach us, that the <hi>Respect</hi> which Men bear to the Word, is an infallible <hi>touchstone,</hi> whereby to try their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Condition. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.6. <hi>He that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40872:78"/>beareth not us.</hi> No Person that hears the Word <hi>aright,</hi> can be in a <hi>bad state,</hi> tho he may do some things amiss; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he that does not hear aright, cannot be in a <hi>good</hi> State, tho some particular Acts may have a plausible Appearance. Now that which thus <hi>turns the Scale,</hi> must undoubtedly be of great and eminent Importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, How</hi> is this Duty to be <hi>performed. Ans.</hi> In six Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With <hi>constant Diligence.</hi> Prov. 8.34. <hi>Blessed is the Man that heareth me, watching daily at my Gates,</hi> &amp;c. They have no Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to this Promise, who are frequently <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from coming</hi> to Wisdom's Doors, or that <hi>do not watch</hi> when they are there. As the Opportunities of hearing are not to be <hi>omitted</hi> upon slender grounds, so a <hi>strict At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> in hearing ought to be kept up, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.48. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.13. Our <hi>bear Presence</hi> in Places of <hi>solemn Assembly</hi> can never be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to excuse us, or to answer the <hi>end of the Commandment.</hi> It may very well be enquir'd of some shameful <hi>Drones,</hi> as it was of <hi>jonah</hi> when he <hi>slept</hi> in the Storm, <hi>What they mean?</hi> Whether they take the <hi>Bed</hi> of Ordinances to be a place of <hi>slothful</hi> rather than <hi>spiritual, rest?</hi> And whether they fancy that God will <hi>always</hi> appear to them, as he did <hi>once</hi> to <hi>Solomon</hi> (1 Kings 3.5.) <hi>in a Dream?</hi> But there are others almost as far from <hi>giving earnest heed</hi> (which they should do, <hi>heb.</hi> 2.1.) as they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40872:78"/>that are asleep; I mean, those, the <hi>Eyes</hi> of whose <hi>Minds</hi> are perhaps <hi>at the Ends of the Earth,</hi> and the Eyes of their <hi>Bodies</hi> wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to some <hi>nearer Objects,</hi> which at such times they are not at all concern'd with. These <hi>affront</hi> God with their trifling <hi>Mockery,</hi> when they <hi>sit before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. With <hi>serious Reverence.</hi> If they that speak should <hi>speak as the Oracles of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.11. They that hear, should do it, as <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes</hi> those Oracles also. Not only in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming <hi>Posture,</hi> (as <hi>all the People stood up,</hi> when <hi>Ezra open'd the Book of the Law,</hi> Neh. 8.5.) but especially in an <hi>awful Frame,</hi> which the <hi>Word of such a King,</hi> tho pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his inferior <hi>Officers,</hi> justly calls for. When <hi>Samuel</hi> came to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> upon an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand from God, the <hi>Elders of the Town trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at his Coming,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.4. And that which mightily increased <hi>Titus</hi> his esteem of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was the <hi>Remembrance of their Obedience, how with fear and trembling they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.15. A respect to the <hi>Persons of Ministers,</hi> (tho really <hi>Due,</hi> and will be <hi>paid</hi> by those that consider who emploies them, yet) signifies nothing, without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>Matter of their Ministry;</hi> for Christ threatens a <hi>Wo to them that built the Tombs of the Prophets,</hi> Mat. 23.29. but minded not their <hi>Doctrine.</hi> We should be as <hi>filially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid</hi> of the <hi>Judgments of God's Mouth,</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are <hi>servilely</hi> of the <hi>Judgments of his Hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:40872:79"/> 3. With <hi>sincere Affection</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi> Whatsoever <hi>Truths</hi> are not <hi>receiv'd in Love,</hi> are really not receiv'd to any saving Purpose. The Words of God should be not only <hi>hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catcht</hi> as (as the Words of <hi>abab</hi> by <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi>'s Servants) but <hi>eaten,</hi> like Food, which a Man hath the sharpest <hi>Appetite</hi> to, and takes sweetest <hi>Pleasure</hi> in, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 15.16. The <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> of old were to <hi>come</hi> from the Places where they sojourned in <hi>Israel, with all the desire of their Mind to the Place which God had chosen,</hi> Deut. 18.6. So should we come to hear the <hi>Words of Eternal Life.</hi> The Fame of <hi>Solomon's Wisdom</hi> brought the <hi>Queen of</hi> Sheba <hi>from the uttermost Parts of the Earth,</hi> Mat. 12.42. <hi>i. e.</hi> from a very distant Country, near a <hi>thousand Miles</hi> off, (as some compute) and yet it was not so tedious to her, as perhaps <hi>such a number of sleps</hi> is to many upon a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Occasion. If Love to the Word be our <hi>Spur</hi> and Motive in coming to it, it will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us upon <hi>Eagle's wings;</hi> and if it be not so, there can be no rational Hope of our <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting</hi> by the Word.</p>
               <p n="4">4. With settled <hi>Resolutions and Designs</hi> of suitable <hi>Obedience. Set your Hearts</hi> (says <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>) <hi>to all the Words which I testifie among you this Day, which you shall command your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to observe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut</hi> 32.46. There is no <hi>Attention</hi> which is significant, or servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but what is in order to <hi>practical Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> No Ordinance of God was ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed only to <hi>employ the Ear,</hi> or inform the Judgment, but to assect the Soul, and <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40872:79"/>the Life.</hi> And if this end be not unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly proposed, a Man may <hi>multiply</hi> his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sermons, with as little Effect, as the <hi>Pharisees enlarg'd their Phylacteries,</hi> which were <hi>Scrolls of Parchment,</hi> whereon they <hi>wrote</hi> some Memorials of the Law, when there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it written on their Hearts, nor much <hi>legible</hi> in their Conversations. We should resolve (as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, but perform better) to <hi>do according to all things,</hi> and that <hi>we will obey the Voice of God, whether it be Good or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> whether it agree with out own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Interests, or be contrary to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. 5,6. If this be not the <hi>full bent</hi> of our Spirits, we <hi>deceive our selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. There must be a <hi>mixture of Faith</hi> with the Word which we hear, or it will not be useful to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. There seems to be an Allusion in that Place to the mingling of the <hi>natural ferment in the Stomach</hi> with our Food, which procures both <hi>Digestion</hi> and <hi>Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> or else the <hi>Food</hi> would be rather hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than profitable, and lay up matter for <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diseases.</hi> This is called very frequently a <hi>receiving</hi> of the Word; <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>c.</hi> 8.14. <hi>c.</hi> 11.1. 'Tis a <hi>taking of it into the Soul,</hi> that it may be an internal ruling Principle; as by Faith we <hi>receive our Lord Christ</hi> himself, <hi>that he may dwell in our Hearts</hi> also.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information.</hi> 1. It will be <hi>worse</hi> for those that are not the <hi>better</hi> by the Word, than if they had it not. No Persons are accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the neglect of Means which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy'd; none shall be condemn'd for <hi>not hearing,</hi> who <hi>cannot</hi> if they would; but where the Word is sent, and yet <hi>put away,</hi> their Condemnation is aggravated. As it was a far greater shame to the <hi>Disciples</hi> who had conversed so much with <hi>Christ,</hi> to be ignorant
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40872:80"/>of the <hi>Parable,</hi> than for the <hi>common People,</hi> and therefore Christ upbraids them, <hi>Are you without Ʋnder standing also?</hi> Mark 7.18. Where the <hi>way of Salvation</hi> is utterly <hi>hid,</hi> they are less guilty, than such as <hi>turn their Backs</hi> upon the <hi>discovery</hi> of it. 2. <hi>Ministers</hi> have just ground of <hi>complaint</hi> against too many <hi>Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Hearers,</hi> for the <hi>lost labour</hi> bestow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. <hi>Deaf Adders</hi> fill up Multitudes of Seats. As the <hi>Prophet</hi> said, it may with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Reason be said again; <hi>Jerem.</hi> 6.10. <hi>To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold their Ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken.</hi> This is the Case of Hundreds, who pretend to great obsequious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And indeed an <hi>Auditory</hi> consisting of <hi>Publicans and Sinners</hi> (like that <hi>Luke</hi> 15.1.) is far more hopeful, than one made up of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Hypocrites,</hi> who drive on a <hi>Trade</hi> of hearing without any sollicitude, whether they get real good by it. 3. God hath great <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to withdraw</hi> the Means, where they are <hi>ungratefully contemn'd.</hi> As the <hi>Blind Man</hi> who had been restored to his sight by Christ, answer'd the <hi>Jews</hi> very well, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated their captious and frivolous Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>I have told you already, and you did not hear; wherefore would you hear it again?</hi> John 9.27. The way to secure our selves in the <hi>Possession</hi> of any Priviledge, is to <hi>improve</hi> it; but where that is wholy wanting, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the Priviledge be lost. It is manifest Justice, that the <hi>Prophets</hi> (like <hi>Zacharias,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Baptist</hi>) should be <hi>Lumb,</hi> when
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40872:81"/>the People <hi>refuse to hearken.</hi> The <hi>silencing</hi> of a Gospel-Ministry is a natural Punishment for the Sin of its <hi>Despisers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. Consider well, <hi>whom,</hi> as well as <hi>what,</hi> you <hi>hear.</hi> The <hi>Prophets</hi> whom the <hi>Rich Man's Brethren</hi> are referr'd to, are link't with <hi>Moses,</hi> an <hi>authentick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> to distinguish them from the <hi>false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that were among the People,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1. Christ speaks of the <hi>Thieves and Robbers which came before him</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> came without being <hi>sent</hi>) that the <hi>Sheep did not hear them;</hi> which is not mentioned as their Sin, but to their Commendation, <hi>John</hi> 10.8. They that have <hi>learned Christ,</hi> will chuse no such <hi>Masters.</hi> Men that have no true <hi>Commission</hi> from God, will do no <hi>Service</hi> to Souls. This is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.22. <hi>If they had stood in my Counsel, and caused my People to hear my Words, then they should have turned them from their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil way,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Be sure to do that in <hi>reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which you so often <hi>appear to do.</hi> You may as well utterly <hi>forbear,</hi> as not hear <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> It will be sad to be found in their number, who <hi>in hearing, hear not,</hi> Mat. 13.13. For this is as possible, as a <hi>Bodily sight</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things joyn'd with <hi>Mental Blindness</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibility. So we are to understand those Words of <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Israel</hi> (which are <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Contradictory</hi>), Deut. 29.2, 3, 4. <hi>You have seen all that the Lord did before your Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet the Lord hath not given you Eyes to see.</hi> Hear, as under the <hi>Inspection</hi> of God, and so that you may approve your selves in this Act
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40872:81"/>to him. 3. <hi>Examine</hi> your selves frequently with relation to the <hi>Benefit</hi> which you reap by doing it. See (1.) Whether the Work of God be <hi>begun</hi> by the Ministry of his Word, which you give your attendance to; whether that <hi>Evangelical Promise</hi> be yet fulfilled in you, of the <hi>Ears of the Deaf being unstopped,</hi> Isa. 35.5. So that the <hi>Passage</hi> to the Heart may be <hi>free and open.</hi> (2.) Whether it be <hi>carried on</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>Obstructions</hi> which it meets with. Take an impartial <hi>measure of your growth</hi> by the Word, that you may not only be certified of your <hi>spiritual Life,</hi> but know how much is <hi>added to your Stature.</hi> If the Consciences of our <hi>Auditors</hi> were but <hi>weekly</hi> busied in such Reflections, we should have <hi>more and better Christians.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>Answer</hi> given by <hi>Abraham</hi> in the preceding Words to the <hi>Rich Man's Request,</hi> being displeasing and unsatisfactory to him, this Verse holds forth his <hi>Reply; And he</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Rich Man) <hi>said,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein we may take notice of two things, his <hi>bold Contradiction</hi> to what <hi>Abraham</hi> had said, and <hi>peremptory insisting</hi> upon what he had said <hi>himself.</hi> 1. His bold <hi>Contradiction</hi> to what <hi>Abraham</hi> had said; [<hi>Nay, Father</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham]. Words favouring of a great deal of Confidence and Rudeness in one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess't himself <hi>Abraham's Son.</hi> When <hi>Elisha</hi> told the <hi>Shunamite</hi> who had no Child, that she should have one in a little time, she being <hi>distracted</hi> (as it were) between two contrary Passions of excessive <hi>Joy</hi> and unbelieving <hi>Fear,</hi> delivers her self after a somewhat <hi>indecent</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Nay, my Lord, thou Man of God, do not lye unto thine Handmaid,</hi> 2 Kings 4.16. But this was much worse, and indeed little better
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40872:82"/>than a positive <hi>giving of the lye</hi> to the <hi>Father of the Faithful;</hi> intimating that not to be the <hi>aptest means</hi> and likliest course for his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren's</hi> Conversion, which <hi>Abraham</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd <hi>as such.</hi> It might reasonably have been ask't, which <hi>way went the Spirit of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from</hi> that Holy Venerable <hi>Patriarch, to him</hi> a vile and miserable Wretch, that when the <hi>Hearing of</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets</hi> was propos'd, he should dare to say, <hi>Nay,</hi> to it? If <hi>Job</hi> in his Prosperity was so respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Princes laid their Hands upon their Mouths, and Nobles held their Peace before him,</hi> Job 29.9, 10. How much more becoming, would it have been for this <hi>Rich Man in Hell</hi> silently to acquiesce in what was spoken by <hi>Abraham,</hi> a <hi>glorified Saint?</hi> But this is to shew, how insolently the <hi>God of</hi> Abraham (tho infinitely <hi>greater than all</hi>) is treated by rebellious Worms. 2. His peremptory <hi>insisting</hi> upon what he had said himself. <hi>[But if one went unto them from the Dead, they will repent.] q. d.</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets</hi> will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate as little upon <hi>them,</hi> as they have done upon <hi>me;</hi> I heard them many a Year, while I liv'd upon Earth, and was never the better, and therefore I conclude by my self, that that will avail them nothing; but if thou wouldst Order <hi>Lazarus</hi> to go and preach to them the <hi>Terrors of Damnation,</hi> according to my desire, I dare engage that this will do the business, and answer the end. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble here, that the <hi>Rich Man</hi> laies all the stress upon the <hi>outward Means,</hi> and the influence
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40872:83"/>which they would have, without making any mention of the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> as that which must produce the desir'd Effect. He does not speak with that <hi>modesty</hi> which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Peradventure God will give them Repentance,</hi> but absolutely, <hi>they will repent,</hi> as if the Issue were certain and in their <hi>own Power.</hi> So the conceited <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> cryed, <hi>If we had been in the Days of our Fathers, we would not have been Partakers with them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.30. Whereas an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul that's sensible of the <hi>deceitfulness of indwelling Sin,</hi> would rather have said, I think, or I hope that I should not have done as they did, or I would not have partaken with them, if God had pleas'd to help me by his <hi>renewing</hi> and <hi>restraining</hi> Grace against my own Corruption. We cannot of our selves conquer the <hi>Impenitency of our Hearts,</hi> whatever Means are afforded to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>Obs. <hi>It is one great instance of the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our sinful Natures, to oppose our foolish groundless Fancies to God's wise and righteous Institutions.</hi> Here

                  <hi>First,</hi> Wherein does it appear, that Men are <hi>naturally Prone</hi> to oppose their own <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> to God's <hi>Institutions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By their <hi>finding Fault</hi> with the <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God.</hi> There are many <hi>Charges</hi> which carnal Men are ready to bring against them. As, 1. They frequently accuse them of <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> they are not <hi>pompous and magnificent</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. When the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd out of Captivity, God encourag'd them to build the <hi>Temple</hi> again, by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that <hi>the Glory of the latter House should be greater than of the former,</hi> Hag. 2.9. Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby a <hi>spiritual</hi> Glory (which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>Glory that excelleth</hi>) by the <hi>Presence of Jesus Christ.</hi> But after this second Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was built, because it wanted the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Splendour of the first, they vilified and despis'd it, and for that very Reason grew careless and negligent about the Services per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in it; they <hi>offer'd polluted Bread upon God's Altar, and said, his Table was contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,</hi> Mal. 1.7. 2. They Charge them with <hi>inconvenience;</hi> as if they were too <hi>severe and burdensome,</hi> and encroacht upon the rightful Liberty and ease of Humane Life. It was the express Ordinance of God, that <hi>all the Males in</hi> Israel <hi>should appear before him thrice in the Year at the Place which he had chosen;</hi> but <hi>Jeroboam</hi> insinuates the tediousness of this to the People; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.28. <hi>It is too much for you to go up to</hi> Jerusalem. <hi>Q. d.</hi> as the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40872:84"/>
                  <hi>Angel</hi> told <hi>Elijah</hi> in another Case, <hi>the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is too great,</hi> and you may as well go near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er home, without such needless Pain and Trouble. So they in the Prophet cryed out, <hi>Behold, what a weariness is it?</hi> Mal. 1.13. The Work which God puts Men upon, is counted a Bondage and a <hi>Toil.</hi> 3. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them with <hi>insufficiency,</hi> as if they were not capable of reaching the end, but were <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>useless,</hi> and might be let alone to as much purpose as attended on. So the same People mentioned before, exclaim'd, that <hi>It was vain to serve God, and what Profit was it, that they had kept his Ordinance?</hi> Mal. 3.14. As if <hi>compassing of God's Altar,</hi> had been a fruitless <hi>labouring in the Fire;</hi> and as if wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon him, had been like their lamented <hi>watching for a Nation which could not save them.</hi> Such is the wretched <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> which is lodg'd in Men's Hearts by Nature, and apt to break forth, when stirr'd up by Temptation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By their venturing to <hi>set up their own Inventions,</hi> against God's plainnest Commands, and severest Threatenings. The <hi>Building of an Altar, besides the Altar of God</hi> was stiled <hi>Rebellion against him,</hi> Josh. 22.19. Yet 'tis that which Men too often assume the boldness to Practise, in despite of all that the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Lawgiver</hi> hath said to deterr from it. So they are called a <hi>rebellious People, which walk after their own Thoughts,</hi> Isa. 65.2. But Men will rather break the Bonds of their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to God, than not vent and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40872:84"/>an Humour of their own; so strong is the Propension to <hi>Coyn</hi> new and uninstitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ways of serving God, which they have no warrant for, but their <hi>Superstitious</hi> Self-will. This was the Case of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who <hi>ordain'd a Feast on the fifteenth Day of the eighth Month, even in the Month which he had devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of his own Heart,</hi> 1 Kings 12.32, 33. It is said to be <hi>like the Feast which was in</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <hi>viz.</hi> The Feast of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> which was on the fifteenth Day of the <hi>seventh</hi> Month; now <hi>Jeroboam</hi> took upon him to alter the <hi>Time,</hi> and appoint another Season for it, differing from God's. Men's doing of those things in Religion, which never <hi>came into God's Heart,</hi> nor were ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in his Word, is a manifest instance of their presumptuous <hi>Opposition,</hi> where they owe the most entire and punctual <hi>Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By their <hi>obstinate Fondness of</hi> their own Inventions, and <hi>adhaerence</hi> to them. This the Holy Ghost takes notice of, as an additional Circumstance of Guilt; <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.3. <hi>They have chosen their own Ways, and their Soul delighteth in their Abominations.</hi> They did not (it seems) repent of their Choice, but pursued it with Pleasure; their own Ways still ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing most eligible and amiable to them, tho most loathsome and odious to God. This is evidenc't sometimes, 1. In <hi>magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>applauding</hi> that which carries their own <hi>stamp,</hi> above that which is dignified with God's. All Men are inclin'd by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40872:85"/>to give the Preference to the Issue of their own <hi>vain Imaginations,</hi> as if that were fairer than any thing which is <hi>impress'd with Divine Authority.</hi> As when <hi>Naaman the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> was bidden to <hi>go and wash in</hi> Jordan <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times,</hi> he speaks of it with disdain, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.12. <hi>Are not</hi> Abana <hi>and</hi> Pharpar <hi>Rivers of</hi> Damascus, <hi>better than all the Waters of</hi> Israel? Men think that there is more <hi>Vertue</hi> in what they find out and fix upon themselves, than in any <hi>Remedies</hi> of God's Prescription. 2. In <hi>setting aside</hi> the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God to <hi>make way</hi> for their own devices. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> are taxed in the Prophet's Time, with <hi>forsaking the Law, and not walking therein,</hi> but <hi>walking after the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of their own Hearts,</hi> Jerem. 9.13, 14. And so the <hi>Elders</hi> in Christ's time, <hi>made the Commands of God void, and of none Effect, by their Traditions,</hi> Mat. 15.6. They rather would disanul and cancel a <hi>Law</hi> of God's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, than not establish an <hi>Order</hi> of their own; like those <hi>Philistines</hi> at <hi>Ashdod,</hi> who cryed, that the <hi>Ark of the God of</hi> Israel should not abide with them, because their <hi>Dagon</hi> had suffer'd thereby, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.7. 3. In at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing any <hi>miscarriage</hi> they meet with, to the <hi>disuse</hi> of their own Methods, and the <hi>following</hi> of God's. This discovers a mighty Zeal <hi>for</hi> that which God testifies his hottest displeasure <hi>against;</hi> (I say, his <hi>hottest displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;</hi> for even when he hath exercis'd <hi>forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mercy</hi> to the <hi>Persons,</hi> he hath <hi>taken Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on their Inventions,</hi> Psalm 99.8.)
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40872:85"/>This betrays a Resolution to <hi>hold fast,</hi> what the rebukes of Providence urge us to <hi>let go;</hi> putting a <hi>false Interpretation</hi> on those rebukes, as if they were design'd to punish us for <hi>omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> that which we most hainously Sin in <hi>doing.</hi> So <hi>Jerem.</hi> 44.18. <hi>Since we have left off to burn Incense to the Queen of Heaven</hi> (wherein they are said to <hi>do what went forth out of their own Mouth,</hi> ver. 17.) <hi>we have wanted all things, and been consumed,</hi> &amp;c. As if that forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Idolatry had been the <hi>root of their Misery,</hi> which was rather a <hi>Fruit meet for Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What <hi>Causes</hi> does this spring and <hi>proceed from? Ans.</hi> There are four grand Principles which this Evil seems to be most genuinely resolv'd into. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Pride.</hi> There is that arrogant aspiring Temper in all the <hi>Posterity</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> as in <hi>Adam</hi> himself, when he begun to fall; they would be <hi>as Gods</hi> to themselves, prescribing the Manner of their own <hi>Worship,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving the Way of their, own <hi>Salvation.</hi> Thus <hi>Naaman,</hi> a <hi>great Man and honourable,</hi> took it ill, that the Prophet did not indulge his Fancy in working his Cure, just as he expected; <hi>He was wroth and went away</hi> (till his Servants wisely and calmly perswaded him to submit) <hi>and said, behold I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the Name of the Lord his God, and strike his Hand over the Hace, and recover the Leper,</hi> 2 Kings
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40872:86"/>4.11. He lookt upon himself as fit to be the <hi>Master of the Ceremonies</hi> in his own Case. The proud Hearts and lofty Spirits of many in the World (not subdued by Grace) would have God to step out of the Road of his Appointment, as if they scorn'd to be sav'd in the <hi>common Way;</hi> so the <hi>Rich Man</hi> here, was for the changing of God's ordinary Course for the reclaiming of his Brethren; as if his <hi>Family</hi> deserv'd the peculiar Honour of an <hi>express</hi> (as one says) from the Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World, and as if it had been worth <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>'s labour to come from Heaven for <hi>their sakes,</hi> tho not upon the account of other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Persons. Such is the inexcusable <hi>haughtiness</hi> of Man, which lies at the Bottom of his Oppositions to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Self-Love.</hi> This is mention'd as the <hi>leading Sin</hi> in that black Catalogue, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. And 'tis indeed the <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence abundance of monstrous Evils flow. <hi>Self</hi> is the great <hi>idol</hi> which all Mankind na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally have in Admiration, and prostrate every thing to; they cannot bear that <hi>Self</hi> should be thwarted or cross't in any Point; this <hi>touches the Apple of their Eye,</hi> and puts them in a rage, as we see Multitudes often, who have nothing to quarrel at, but this, that the <hi>Ways of God are not as their Ways.</hi> Whatever <hi>Self</hi> is concern'd and interested in, is always a very <hi>tender</hi> Case; as if that had <hi>Prerogatives</hi> which <hi>none</hi> must meddle with, or offer to diminish; no, not the <hi>Soveraign</hi> of all. That which is a Man's own Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40872:86"/>how irregular and deform'd soever it be, will have such a Sentence pronounc't upon it, as the <hi>Irimitive Creation</hi> had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is <hi>his own. God saw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good,</hi> Gen. 1.31. That was <hi>really</hi> so, as it was declar'd to be; and Self-Love blinds our Judgments into the same <hi>Opinion</hi> of what we do, tho it be most groundless.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Curiosity.</hi> Men's foolish <hi>wanton</hi> Spirits render them weary of <hi>walking in the Old Paths,</hi> and if God do not <hi>make some now thing</hi> for them, they will be <hi>forming</hi> something them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. New <hi>Revelations</hi> and Methods of Conviction are more pleasing and grateful than any other, meerly because they are <hi>new. Paul</hi> had quickly crowds of <hi>Athenians</hi> about him, because he seemed to Preach <hi>new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and <hi>strange Things,</hi> Acts 17.19, 20. An extravagant <hi>itch after Novelty</hi> hath been a <hi>Disease</hi> entail'd upon Mankind, ever since our first Parents ruin'd themselves and their whole Offspring, by <hi>affecting to know more</hi> than they did. Men are not satisfied with making <hi>Experiments</hi> which they have oft <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,</hi> but covet to try other Means, which <hi>have not been tryed before.</hi> The <hi>Hearing of</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets</hi> hath been pract's'd so long, that the <hi>Vanity</hi> of our carnal Minds prompts us now to take some other Course; whereas indeed Truths of the most <hi>ancient Date,</hi> are the most valuable, and <hi>that which we have heard from the beginning,</hi> should the rather for that Reason <hi>abide in us,</hi> 1 John 2.24.</p>

                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:40872:87"/> 4. <hi>Perverseness.</hi> There is such an Hellish <hi>Contrariety</hi> to God himself in our corrupted Natures, that we are prone to dislike every thing the <hi>more for his sake,</hi> and to Object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this or that Divine Institution, <hi>because it is Divine;</hi> as if God, who <hi>does all things well,</hi> did <hi>nothing</hi> so. The Authority of God is so far from <hi>recommending</hi> any thing to the choice of a natural Man, that he is thereby the more <hi>prejudic'd</hi> and set against it. What he <hi>forbids,</hi> is <hi>pleasing</hi> to the sinful Soul, and what he <hi>commands,</hi> is <hi>grievous.</hi> The Devil hath infus'd this malignity into our <hi>tainted Blood,</hi> that what is the <hi>ground</hi> of our <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> is the <hi>Motive</hi> and Temptation to our <hi>Rebellion. The carnal Mind is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7. Sin is <hi>irritated</hi> by that very Precept which is given to <hi>suppress</hi> it; and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tends to curb our <hi>licentiousness,</hi> still dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers so much the more of our <hi>frowardness.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> were never more <hi>zealous</hi> for God's Appointments, than when he was about to <hi>abolish</hi> them, and after they were actually abolisht. When God said, <hi>bring no more vain Oblations,</hi> they were most forward to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them; and when he gave them the Character of <hi>beggarly Elements,</hi> they then most eagerly <hi>desir'd to be in Bondage to them,</hi> Gal. 4.9. Yea, if we had the Liberty of <hi>adding to the Words</hi> of God, 'tis questiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whether we should be so strongly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd</hi> to it, as now that we are <hi>restrained</hi> from it.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:40872:87"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why we <hi>ought not</hi> to oppose our own Fancies to the Institutions of God? The <hi>Reasons</hi> are obvious.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis a notorious <hi>forgetting of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> and <hi>leaving of our Place,</hi> as Creatures, and <hi>usurping</hi> of God's <hi>essential Right.</hi> Is it a fit thing, that the Creator should be <hi>controul'd</hi> by his own Workmanship? <hi>Shall the Clay say to him that fashions it, what makest thou?</hi> Isa. 45.9. Which of the two, is the most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that God should lay his <hi>Injunctions upon us,</hi> or that we should <hi>impose upon him?</hi> Judge impartially in the Case betwixt him and your selves; whether the <hi>most High should stoop</hi> to such despicable Worms as you, or whether you should yield and comply with him? It is a <hi>silencing Challenge,</hi> which the Apostle makes in his Name; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Nay, but oh Man, who art thou that replyest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God?</hi> q. d. Dost thou consider thy Quality, how much thou art <hi>Inferior</hi> to him? Dost thou remember, who gave thee thy <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and consequently, who is to have the <hi>Dominion</hi> over thee? Wast thou not <hi>produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his Power,</hi> and shouldst thou not be <hi>govern'd by his Pleasure?</hi> Know that he is <hi>God,</hi> and that thou art but a <hi>Man;</hi> think seriously of this, and then attempt any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to his declared will, if thou canst.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is an <hi>imputing of Folly</hi> to God, and an ascribing of <hi>greater Knowledge</hi> and Prudence to our selves. This is the plain and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40872:88"/>Consequence of our taking upon us to <hi>direct</hi> or <hi>dictate</hi> any thing, that shall mend or outdo the Institutions of God; for whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever prescribes any <hi>Rules</hi> or <hi>Models</hi> to God, besides what he hath given and fram'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, does indeed <hi>Deifie his own Ʋnderstanding</hi> against <hi>Infinite Wisdom.</hi> And hath any Man in the World such a <hi>Erow of Brass,</hi> as to assert and justifie this, that he knows better than God, or sees further than the <hi>Father of Lights?</hi> As grave and judicious <hi>Elihu</hi> said, <hi>Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My Righteousness is more than God's?</hi> Job 35.2. So may I say, wilt thou not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd to pretend, that thou art wiser than he, who endowed thee with all the <hi>Discretion</hi> thou hast? Canst thou in good earnest, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that God hath <hi>communicated</hi> more Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to thee, than he hath <hi>reserved</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? So it must be, or else the giving of the <hi>Preheminence</hi> to thy own Fancies, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable <hi>Dotage.</hi> Be sensible of thy true <hi>bruitishness</hi> before God, and thou wilt despise what thou admirest.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a real <hi>committing of spiritual Ʋnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Every Word</hi> and Appointment <hi>of God is pure,</hi> Prov. 30.5. But we <hi>pollute</hi> our selves by bringing in any thing of our own, in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition,</hi> or so much as in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with it; as it is said of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that they were <hi>defiled with their own Works, and went a whoring with their own Inventions,</hi> Psalm 106.39. He that makes himself in any respect his own Idol, contracts a <hi>filthiness in his own
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40872:88"/>Spirit,</hi> and is guilty of <hi>Heart-adultery.</hi> The <hi>strange Woman</hi> is said to <hi>forsake the Guide of her Youth;</hi> i. e. her Husband, whom the Holy Ghost gives that Title to, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.17. And for them that profess the like <hi>Relation</hi> to Jesus Christ, to renounce his <hi>Conduct,</hi> is a Crime of the <hi>same sort,</hi> but of much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Aggravation. The setting up of our foolish and empty Conceits against his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and regular Establishments, is an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Lust,</hi> which consists not with our Love and Faithfulness to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All Divine Appointments are <hi>excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suited</hi> for the attainment of their <hi>proper Ends.</hi> If we are defeated of the Advantage which we should reap from them by our <hi>own Corruption,</hi> this must not be ascribed to any <hi>defect</hi> in the Means, <hi>as such,</hi> for the Fault is in our selves. The badness of the <hi>Soil</hi> does not in the least detract from the goodness of the <hi>Seed</hi> which is cast into it. If the Word does <hi>not Profit</hi> Men, 'tis not any thing <hi>amiss</hi> in the Word, but the <hi>evil Disposition</hi> of the Hearers, which is the true Cause of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proficiency. Even as the Case now stands, God will certainly and infallibly bring about his gracious Designs and Purposes <hi>by the Word,</hi> with respect to all his chosen ones; for he hath said, that <hi>it shall not return unto him void,</hi> Isa. 55.11. And tho it hath not the same saving effect upon other Persons, the Word will be vindicated still, because the fatal <hi>obstacles</hi> lye at our <hi>own Doors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:40872:89"/> 5. When God hath provided those Means which are <hi>sufficient in their kind,</hi> 'tis inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Presumption to expect, that he should <hi>alter</hi> or <hi>add,</hi> meerly for our <hi>Gratification,</hi> Where <hi>ordinary Helps</hi> are afforded, which will serve Men's occasions, <hi>Miracles</hi> are not <hi>superfluously</hi> wrought; as when the <hi>Jews</hi> came to eat of the <hi>Fruit of the Land of</hi> Canaan, the <hi>Manna ceased on the Morrow,</hi> and they had it no more, <hi>Josh.</hi> 5.12. The same God who readily supplies our <hi>Necessity,</hi> will not Countenance our <hi>Wantonness. An Evil and Adulterous Generation</hi> (says our Lord) <hi>seeketh after a Sign, but there shall no Sign be given to it, but the Sign of the Prophet</hi> Jonas, which they had before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.39. This was enough, and therefore he would grant no more, nor could any more be justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. So here, their <hi>Destruction</hi> is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserved, that cannot be content with the <hi>Word of Salvation,</hi> but must be craving <hi>something else in the room of it,</hi> which they imagine (but without Reason, as we shall afterwards see) to be <hi>more Effectual.</hi> It is our Duty not only to be <hi>satisfied</hi> with this, but to be very <hi>thankful</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>ƲSE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information.</hi> 1. Hence we see the wretched <hi>Original</hi> of the various sorts of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Superstition</hi> and <hi>Will-worship,</hi> which are in the World. <hi>Ʋpright Man</hi> was perfectly under the Direction and Government of his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40872:89"/>Maker, but <hi>Apostate</hi> Man hath <hi>sought out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inventions,</hi> Eccles. 7.29. There is a <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Devices</hi> in his Heart, that fruitful Womb of a cursed Offspring. There are <hi>swarms</hi> of <hi>false Religions,</hi> and of strange Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and Usages belonging to them, all devised by Men; whereas there is, and can be, but <hi>one,</hi> which is <hi>of God.</hi> God is not the <hi>Author of</hi> such <hi>Confusion,</hi> as Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions often make under the shew and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Order.</hi> He hath <hi>shewed us what is good,</hi> in telling us what he hath <hi>required of us,</hi> Mic. 6.8. For that which is <hi>not requir'd,</hi> can have but an <hi>appearance of Good,</hi> which the mistaken Founders undeservedly cloth it with. 2. This teaches us, that whenever God <hi>leaves Men</hi> to their own Follies, and seems to <hi>indulge</hi> them therein, 'tis in a way of <hi>Judgment and Displeasure.</hi> It is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Favour, but the contrary, when he <hi>chuses their Delusions,</hi> and <hi>fills them with their own Devices;</hi> it is not because he <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves</hi> them, but because he is provok'd to <hi>deliver Men over</hi> to be undone by them. We have a woful Instance of this; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.24, 25. <hi>Because they despised my Statutes, and executed not my Judgments, but their Eyes were after their Fathers idols, wherefore I gave them also Statutes which were not good, and Judgments whereby they should not live;</hi> i. e. Such as did not <hi>commend</hi> them to God, nor were they <hi>beneficial</hi> to themselves. Not that God ever <hi>enjoyn'd</hi> them any such, but he <hi>gave them</hi> up to make such <hi>for themselves,</hi> which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40872:90"/>they were as forward to do, as <hi>Judas</hi> was to compleat his Treason, when he had Christ's <hi>Permission,</hi> tho not his <hi>Precept,</hi> John 13.27, 30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. Let <hi>every Thought which exalts it self</hi> in you against the Mind and Will of God, be <hi>captivated to his Obedience.</hi> Dare not to <hi>allow</hi> or <hi>cherish</hi> the least opposite Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The most Pure and Happy State of the Church on Earth, is that which is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 3.17. When <hi>Jerusalem shall be called the Throne of the Lord, and all Nations shall be gather'd thither to the Name of the Lord, neither shall they walk any more after the Imagination of their Evil Heart.</hi> The more we abandon our own <hi>Judgments and Wills,</hi> the more we lift up the <hi>Throne</hi> and the <hi>Name</hi> of God; and the more we promote and advance the coming of Christ's blessed <hi>Kingdom,</hi> wherein <hi>all things that offend</hi> shall be <hi>taken out of the way,</hi> and no Power or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest shall ever be able to introduce them again. 2. Be always <hi>guided by God's Counsels,</hi> and acquiesce in them as the best which can be follow'd, whether you <hi>discern the Reason</hi> and tendency of them, or not. It was excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said by the <hi>Mother of our Lord</hi> to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at the Marriage-Feast, <hi>Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it,</hi> John 2.5. In all such Cases, we are not to <hi>dispute,</hi> whether it be really <hi>advisable,</hi> for we may be <hi>sure,</hi> that what he appoints, <hi>is so,</hi> and cannot be otherwise. It is impossible to <hi>err,</hi> if we <hi>Resign</hi> our selves absolutely and wholely to him. <hi>I lead in the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40872:90"/>Way of Righteousness,</hi> says <hi>Wisdom,</hi> Prov. 8.20. If therefore God calls us to <hi>go into the Sanctuary,</hi> and attend the Instructions which he gives there, we may safely conclude, that we (like the Rich Man's <hi>Brethren</hi> here) can take <hi>no better</hi> Course, nor any that is <hi>so good.</hi>

               <p>HAving consider'd the <hi>Rich Man's Reply</hi> to <hi>Abraham's first Answer</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verse, I come now to <hi>Abraham's final</hi> Answer in these Words; He had told him before, that the sending of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary,</hi> because they had <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> whom they might hear; <hi>v.</hi> 29.

               <p>In which last Words upon this Subject, we have two Parts, a <hi>Supposition,</hi> and a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> from it. 1. A <hi>Supposition;</hi> [<hi>If they hear not</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> if they will not do, as I have already suggested and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40872:91"/>but continue refractory and incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, notwithstanding such Opportunities and Means; if they will do, as those furious <hi>Murderers</hi> of <hi>Stephen</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.57. <hi>Stop their Ears,</hi> and make Light of that which they have so much Reason to value and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; there is little difference between <hi>their</hi> Case and <hi>yours.</hi> They indeed are yet on <hi>Earth,</hi> and you in <hi>Hell,</hi> but their Condition is <hi>desperate</hi> and hopeless, and the Life which they are now living in the Flesh, will issue as yours hath done. <hi>Abraham</hi> does not say, whether they <hi>would hear</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> for he leaves that still doubtful and undecided (as the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of our Ministry</hi> are to us for the present, with Reference to them that are sitting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it) but he clearly intimates what their End must needs be, <hi>if</hi> they always refuse to hear. 2. The <hi>Conclusion</hi> from this Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>[Neither will they be perswaded, tho one rose from the Dead.]</hi> Our Lord says, that <hi>if the mighty Works which were done in</hi> Chorazin <hi>and</hi> Bethsaida, <hi>had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>they would have repented long before in Sackcloth and Ashes,</hi> Mat. 11.21. But if <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> or any other were <hi>sent from the Dead</hi> to Preach to unconverted Sinners that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd themselves against the stated Preaching of the Gospel by <hi>Living Men,</hi> it would have no <hi>saving Effect</hi> upon them, nor conduce to their <hi>sound Conversion;</hi> it would never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to quit their Lusts, and return heartily to God. They who <hi>turn</hi> God's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Messengers behind them</hi> (as <hi>Jehu</hi> did
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40872:92"/>
                  <hi>Joram's,</hi> a Kings 9.18, 19.) will never be brought to <hi>set their Faces towards</hi> Sion, as they should do, by this <hi>more unlikely</hi> Means. Whatever probability Men may apprehend in <hi>this</hi> Way and Method above the other, they do but flatter themselves with a false Notion; the <hi>Rich Man's Brethren</hi> would have remain'd really <hi>as far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> and in as much danger of Damnation, as they then were, tho <hi>he</hi> had been suffer'd to speed in his extravagant Request for <hi>them.</hi>

                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:40872:92"/> 1. There have been Persons <hi>raised</hi> from the Dead, who have <hi>wrought nothing</hi> upon ungodly Sinners <hi>by their Revival.</hi> When <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> that wicked King of <hi>Israel,</hi> was enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Gehazi,</hi> concerning the great things which his Master <hi>Elisha</hi> had done, the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namite</hi> and her <hi>Son</hi> whom the Prophet had <hi>restor'd to Life,</hi> very providentially present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves before the King, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.4, 5, 6. Which, tho it extorted <hi>one Act</hi> of Justice from him at that Time, yet we do not find, that it made any Reformation in his <hi>Course</hi> of Life. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was <hi>raised from the Dead</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Chief Priests</hi> were so far from being <hi>Converted by</hi> that Miracle (tho they were <hi>Convinc't</hi> of it, <hi>John</hi> 11.47.) that they <hi>consulted how to put him to Death,</hi> because that <hi>others believed on Jesus</hi> by Reason of him, <hi>John</hi> 12.10, 11. There were others also, whom our Lord rais'd up, in the Days of his Flesh, as the <hi>Widow's Son</hi> at <hi>Naim,</hi> and the <hi>Daughter of</hi> Jairus, the Ruler of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> &amp;c. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that <hi>arose</hi> and came and <hi>appear'd in the Holy City</hi> after his <hi>Expiration</hi> on the Cross, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.52, 53. And yet all these contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted nothing to the Cure of that People's <hi>stubborn Infidelity.</hi> Above all, <hi>Christ himself</hi> rose from the Dead; and tho he did <hi>not shew himself openly to all the People, but to a select number of Witnesses,</hi> Acts 10.41. Yet the number was considerable, for <hi>he was seen of above five hundred Brethren at once, of whom
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40872:93"/>the greater part were alive and remain'd,</hi> more than twenty Years after, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. And 'tis manifest, that his Enemies were perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the <hi>Truth of his Resurrection,</hi> and therefore invented a <hi>lye to smother</hi> it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.13. But instead of <hi>embracing his Doctrine</hi> afterwards upon this account, they <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Apostles</hi> most maliciously, for publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They who are <hi>Dead,</hi> tho they be <hi>not raised,</hi> do loudly <hi>speak</hi> to us. It is said par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of <hi>Abel,</hi> a <hi>Righteous</hi> Person, and the <hi>first Martyr</hi> in the World, that <hi>being Dead, he yet speaketh,</hi> Heb. 11.4. (For this Version seems more proper, than that he is yet <hi>spoken of.</hi>) As the <hi>Voice of his Blood cried to God from the Ground,</hi> when it was newly shed, so his Blood hath a very <hi>significant and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Voice with respect <hi>to us</hi> still. <hi>Abel</hi> to this Day by his <hi>untimely Death</hi> speaks to <hi>Saints,</hi> what barbarous Enmity they must look for from <hi>unreasonable Men;</hi> and he speaks to those, who like his <hi>Brother Cain,</hi> are <hi>of the Wicked One,</hi> what Vengeance and Wrath they must look for from a <hi>Just and Holy God;</hi> and this is a <hi>Language and Speech</hi> which may as well be understood, as if he were now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to utter it with his <hi>own Mouth;</hi> like the <hi>Writing</hi> which <hi>Elijah</hi> left behind him to be produc'd and deliver'd after his <hi>Translation</hi> into Heaven, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.12. The sweet <hi>Experiences</hi> of God's deceased Servants, which testifie their <hi>gracious acceptance</hi> with him, call to us to make the same <hi>Trial and Proof</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40872:93"/>which they have done. Their <hi>Works</hi> which (like those of the <hi>Vertuous Woman,</hi> Prov. 31. <hi>ult.</hi>) <hi>Praise them in the Gates,</hi> do naturally <hi>provoke</hi> and stir up us to <hi>Imitation,</hi> as much as if we heard them expresly saying, <hi>Be followers of us,</hi> and deserve as much to be regarded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have seen others <hi>going to the Dead,</hi> when God hath been <hi>stripping them of the Body,</hi> as <hi>Moses did Aaron of his Garments</hi> upon the Mount, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 20.28.) It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that several of us have been <hi>Spectators</hi> of some in their <hi>last Moments,</hi> when they have been passing to Eternity, and <hi>but a step be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt</hi> them and it. We have beheld them <hi>setting,</hi> which is next Degree to a conversing with them <hi>risen again;</hi> and what Advantage have we ever gotten by this, unless the <hi>Word</hi> also hath <hi>taken hold</hi> of us? Perhaps we have seen both sorts, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> Men, upon the immediate <hi>border</hi> of the World to come, and if so, we cannot but have likewise seen a <hi>manifest difference</hi> in their several depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. If we have <hi>mark't the end of the Perfect and Ʋpright Man,</hi> that hath been <hi>Peace;</hi> Psalm 37.37. But how contrary hath the end of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> or the <hi>Prophane</hi> been? The one hath had (like <hi>Stephen</hi>) <hi>the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens open'd,</hi> and the other hath had a view of <hi>Hell naked before him;</hi> one hath <hi>rejoyc'd in the Hope of approaching Glory,</hi> the other hath left this World in the fearful Expectation of endless Misery. It cannot be denied, that such a difference often is; and yet Multitudes
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40872:94"/>who have had the <hi>Opportunity</hi> of seeing it, have nevertheless liv'd and <hi>dyed in their Sin,</hi> after it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is also likely that <hi>we</hi> have been <hi>in Deaths</hi> many times <hi>our selves;</hi> like <hi>Isaac,</hi> who was <hi>receiv'd by</hi> Abraham, in a manner, <hi>from the Dead,</hi> Heb. 11.19. It is no uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing for Persons to <hi>have the Sentence of Death in themselves,</hi> and yet to <hi>outlive</hi> it; to be in <hi>David</hi>'s Case, when the <hi>Sorrows of Death compassed him</hi> (Psalm 116.3.) And yet to <hi>break through</hi> them; to be in <hi>Hazekiah</hi>'s Case, who <hi>reckon'd that he was depriv'd of the residue of his Years, and should then go down to the Gates of the Grave,</hi> (<hi>Isa.</hi> 38.10.) And yet to recover and <hi>come up</hi> again. Thousands have been reduc'd by <hi>prining Sickness</hi> to such great Extremities, that the <hi>Pit</hi> was ready to <hi>take them in,</hi> and <hi>shut it's Mouth upon</hi> them, who by a marvellous and unthought of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, have obtain'd a kind of <hi>new Life;</hi> and yet that new Life hath been as shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>mispent</hi> and abused <hi>as the former,</hi> if not a great deal <hi>worse.</hi> How little Fruit is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be seen of Men's <hi>sick-bed Repentings?</hi> How frequently do they <hi>return to their Folly,</hi> assoon as they <hi>arise from their Beds of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing?</hi> What numerous Instances have there been of such, as have made themselves <hi>twofold more the Children of Hell,</hi> than they were before? Whose fresh <hi>relapses</hi> into their <hi>old Sins</hi> have had more dreadful <hi>Symptoms,</hi> than their <hi>first</hi> wickedness was attended with? As some <hi>Malefactors,</hi> who have been brought
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40872:94"/>back from the <hi>Gallows,</hi> where they <hi>lookt Death in the Face,</hi> have after this <hi>exceeded</hi> all the Villanies of their <hi>past Lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What are the <hi>particular Reasons,</hi> why the sending of one from the Dead should be thus <hi>ineffectual? Ans.</hi> In three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There would be invincible Difficulties and <hi>Objections</hi> against the <hi>Credit of such a Messenger.</hi> If any one should come and <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> (as was desired here) what <hi>Testimonials</hi> could he bring, that might not be scrupled and <hi>call'd into Question?</hi> How should we know, that he is not a <hi>false Witness,</hi> or that it is not a cheat, and an <hi>imposture,</hi> and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Artifice to ensnare and beguile us? Tho it <hi>may be</hi> true, how shall we be fully satisfied that it <hi>is</hi> so? And besides, Sinners who are <hi>Mad upon their Lusts,</hi> will not be very <hi>easie</hi> to receive Satisfaction; whatever <hi>serious Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages</hi> are brought, they will seem (like the Words of the <hi>Women</hi> that came from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,</hi> to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> Luke 24.11.) as <hi>idle Tales,</hi> not fit to be believ'd. When <hi>Lot</hi> told his <hi>Sons in Law</hi> of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s intended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching <hi>Destruction,</hi> he was to them, but <hi>as one that mocked,</hi> like a Man <hi>in Sport,</hi> and in Jest, and so they took no more notice of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.14. Thus, if a <hi>Nunico</hi> from the other World should appear to a Company of <hi>Jolly Sinners</hi> in the midst of their Exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, they would be ready to <hi>deride</hi> him; if <hi>Lazarus</hi> had been sent where the <hi>Rich Man</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:40872:95"/>requested, would they not (do you think) have been apt to cry out, with those <hi>Jews,</hi> John 9.29. <hi>We know that God spake to</hi> Moses, <hi>but as for this Fellow, we know not from whence he is?</hi> He brings up an <hi>evil Report</hi> (as one expresses it) of our Deceased Brother, raises a <hi>scandal</hi> on our Family, and therefore is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be puisht, than hearken'd to!</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Apparitions of the Dead,</hi> tho they might possibly work upon the <hi>Passion of Fear,</hi> would not alter the <hi>Frame and Temper of the Soul.</hi> It may be, they would scare and <hi>affright</hi> the weak and the <hi>timorous,</hi> who are not so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and <hi>stout-hearted</hi> as the rest; but what is this, to the <hi>renewing</hi> and <hi>transforming of the Mind,</hi> and turning the <hi>Bias of the Will?</hi> When the <hi>Angel</hi> descended from Heaven, and sat upon the Stone at the Door of <hi>Christ's Sepulchre,</hi> it is said indeed, that the <hi>Keepers shook, and became as Dead Men;</hi> Mat. 28.4. But did this make them <hi>new Creatures?</hi> Did it put <hi>another Spirit</hi> within them, or render them <hi>Proselites</hi> to our <hi>living Redeemer?</hi> We read of <hi>no such Effect.</hi> So when <hi>Herod</hi> heard of the Fame of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and what he did, he was <hi>perplexed, because it was said of some, that</hi> John <hi>was risen from the Dead,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> whom he had beheaded, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.7. This struck <hi>Terror</hi> and Confusion into him, but it wrought no <hi>amendment.</hi> The most <hi>sensible and startling</hi> Evidences of the Wrath of God, tho they might Creature some <hi>Disturbance,</hi> and hinder that quiet repose which Sinners are wont to take, when they are let alone, yet
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40872:95"/>will leave them as utter Strangers as ever to the <hi>Grace of God in Truth;</hi> they who are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,</hi> will be <hi>unjust still,</hi> and the <hi>Dominion of Sin</hi> will continue undestroyed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Those <hi>Impressions</hi> which are made, and those Effects which are produced <hi>at first</hi> by such Means, will <hi>quickly vanish</hi> and wear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. A settled <hi>lasting</hi> Change (without which there can be no Salvation) is always built upon other <hi>grounds.</hi> If Men be <hi>awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd</hi> a little for the present by Fears of Wrath (like <hi>Felix</hi> with a Discourse of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Judgment) those <hi>trembling Fits</hi> go off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as the <hi>early Dew,</hi> which is gone assoon as the <hi>Sun arises with burning Heat.</hi> Frightful surprizes are but short and <hi>transient</hi> Things, which a <hi>seared Conscience</hi> will soon Free it self from, and the next <hi>pleasing Temptations</hi> will totally abolish. <hi>The Sinners in</hi> Zion <hi>are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid</hi> often, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.14. And yet still want that <hi>Principle of godly Fear,</hi> which should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their <hi>departing from God,</hi> and promote their <hi>departing from Evil;</hi> one is the Fruit of the <hi>Everlasting Covenant,</hi> Jerem. 32.40. The other is only the Product of some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional <hi>temporary Amazement.</hi> If a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the Dead should give Men an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm</hi> at his first Coming, yet when he had deliver'd his Errand, and <hi>retir'd</hi> again, they would soon <hi>forget</hi> what had most affected them; and if this Method were <hi>repeated,</hi> and the like Messengers sent one after another to the same purpose, they would grow by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <hi>Familiar,</hi> and at length <hi>Contemptible.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:40872:96"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wherein it appears, that the send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one from the Dead, is <hi>Inferior</hi> to the Ministry of the Word, and <hi>not worthy to be compared</hi> with it. Consider</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is nothing that can be said by the most <hi>extraordinary Person</hi> whom you can suppose, deserving of any regard, unless it be <hi>according to this Word;</hi> and therefore 'tis a vain thing to <hi>seek to the Dead,</hi> when the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reference</hi> must be <hi>to the Law and to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,</hi> Isa. 8.19, 20. All must be tryed and determin'd by this <hi>Rule,</hi> and brought to this <hi>Standard.</hi> If a <hi>glorified Saint</hi> were to come down upon Earth, and deliver any thing which is not warranted by the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> we must <hi>did Defiance</hi> to him. Such a Temptation can never <hi>actually happen</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>their</hi> Reverence to the Word and it's Divine Author <hi>never faileth</hi>) but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>puts the Case</hi> as high, if not higher, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Tho an Angel from Heaven should preach any other Gospel to you, let him be</hi> (Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, or) <hi>accursed.</hi> And to add an <hi>Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> to it, he says it again, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>If any one,</hi> (for so it ought to be read, and not, If any <hi>Man</hi>) <hi>preach any other Gospel,</hi> &amp;c. Of what rank or <hi>order of Creatures</hi> soever he be, if he vary from this <hi>Canon,</hi> both he and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are to be abhorred.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Ministry of the Word is the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Means</hi> for the Conversion of Sinners, whereas such appearances of the Dead are
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40872:96"/>not. <hi>Devine Institution</hi> gives a <hi>vertue</hi> and force to things which would be worthless and <hi>invalid</hi> without it; as <hi>Clay and Spittle</hi> in the Hand of Christ was a <hi>successful Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the <hi>Blind.</hi> Thus it <hi>pleases God by the foolishness of Preaching to save them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. And the <hi>Gospel is the Power of God to Salvation to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,</hi> Rom. 1.16. It is said to be <hi>able to save our Souls,</hi> James 1.21. Because <hi>ordain'd</hi> by God to <hi>such an End,</hi> and on that score ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with his Blessing. All our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations would be but <hi>beating the Air,</hi> if it were not so; the <hi>Weapons of our Warfare</hi> are therefore <hi>mighty,</hi> because God employs us, and is with us. <hi>Knowing the Terror of the Lord, we perswade Men;</hi> 2 Cor. 5.11. We therefore <hi>perswade</hi> those, whom a Preacher from the Dead <hi>would not perswade.</hi> The <hi>glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Arms</hi> of a <hi>Saint in Light</hi> would do less Execution than this <hi>Consecrated Sword of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Written Word</hi> hath an excellency in it beyond any <hi>Vision</hi> or <hi>Voice from Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Voice</hi> which the <hi>Apostles heard in the Mount</hi> where Christ was transfigur'd, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented as less valuable than this <hi>surer Word of Prophesie,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.18, 19. It is far easier to <hi>counterfeit</hi> such things, than these <hi>lively O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which are given to us.</hi> There would be danger in trusting to <hi>them alone,</hi> but the Scripture is to be believ'd for <hi>its own sake,</hi> and is <hi>worthy of all Acceptation,</hi> if we consider on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Arguments which are drawn and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40872:97"/>from <hi>it self;</hi> for it plainly manifests it self to be from God by its own <hi>internal Light,</hi> and contains all that Evidence of the Truth and Authority of God, which <hi>Divine Faith</hi> is to rest upon. We are sure, that these are <hi>faithful Sayings,</hi> and that we run no hazard of being deceived by them. <hi>Visions and Voices</hi> at the best, are not of a <hi>permanent</hi> abiding Nature; they are seen or heard, and then <hi>pass away;</hi> but the <hi>Word of God endures for ever, and this is the Word which by the Gospel is preacht unto us,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Gospel,</hi> as it is the <hi>Word of Christ,</hi> is much more to be esteem'd, than what any <hi>Saint from the Dead</hi> is capable of speaking; for there is no Comparison between the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or any other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. The register'd <hi>Word of Salvation</hi> is that which <hi>first begun to be spoken by the Lord,</hi> and was afterwards <hi>confirmed to us by them that heard him,</hi> Heb. 2.3. We are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>him,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle and High Priest of our Profession,</hi> the great <hi>Prophet whom God hath raised up,</hi> to whom we are to <hi>hearken</hi> in his Execution of that Office to this Day. He that once <hi>spake on Earth,</hi> does still <hi>speak from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and there is no escaping for those that <hi>turn away from him,</hi> Heb. 12.25. He <hi>came from above,</hi> and is unquestionably <hi>above all,</hi> John 3.31. There is not an <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Saint</hi> in Glory fit to be matcht with him. He is the <hi>Sun of Righteousness,</hi> they are but as <hi>Stars in his Hand.</hi> He is the exalted <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, they never were more than <hi>Servants</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:40872:97"/>to it. He is the <hi>first-born of every Creature,</hi> Col. 1.15. And therefore may justly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge infinitely <hi>more observance and respect</hi> from us, than the best of Creatures can.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>personal Ministry</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if it were to be enjoy'd again, would be <hi>unsuccessful,</hi> where the written Word hath no Effect. If <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> were to leave his Father's Throne where he now sits, and to come down a <hi>second time</hi> upon the Earth, Men would sleight and disregard him, unless they were prevail'd upon to hearken to those that <hi>wrote of him.</hi> This is the very Reason which he gave of the Infidelity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he was Conversant among them, that they did not truly receive the Testimony of <hi>Moses</hi> (whom they pretended to <hi>trust in</hi>) concerning him. <hi>John</hi> 5.46, 47. <hi>Had you believed</hi> Moses, <hi>you would have believed me; but if you believe not his Writings, how shall you believe my Words?</hi> The same Reason would hold, and be of the same force, tho he were to make another Trial, by a repeated <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation in the Flesh,</hi> and Preaching of his own Gospel. They who believe not what is <hi>recorded</hi> in the Scripture of him, would not believe any <hi>verbal Message</hi> that should be brought by him. The <hi>Incarnate Word</hi> would certainly be despis'd by the Contemners of the <hi>Written.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>ƲSe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information.</hi> 1. They that have the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40872:98"/>
                  <hi>liveliest Sense of unseen things,</hi> are not able to <hi>imprint it</hi> upon any beside themselves. If the <hi>Dead</hi> could <hi>communicate</hi> what they hnow, to the <hi>Living,</hi> yet it would not <hi>affect</hi> the one as it does the other. <hi>Destruction and Death</hi> hear of <hi>Wisdom's Fame,</hi> but yet the <hi>worth of it is hid</hi> from the Eyes of those that are alive, <hi>Job</hi> 28.21, 22. Tho the Inhabitants of the Invisible World could <hi>utter</hi> all that they see and feel, to Men that are here below, yet they could not put any <hi>light or warmth</hi> into them; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with a <hi>flaming Seraphim</hi> would leave Men as <hi>dark and cold</hi> as ever. Therefore the Children of God must not think it strange, that the Children of this World will not be brought to <hi>run with them</hi> in the Way of God's Commands, except they could make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>comprehend</hi> what they do. 2. Men that are <hi>in their Sins,</hi> have a great deal of <hi>stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in their Tempers.</hi> As <hi>Aaron</hi> said to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> concerning the <hi>Israelites,</hi> Exod. 32.22. <hi>Thou knowest the People, that they are set on Mischief;</hi> which was a real Truth, tho it did not excuse his Accession to their <hi>Idolatry.</hi> It is very hard to <hi>withdraw</hi> Sinners <hi>from their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi> tho you acquaint them with the Miseries which will follow upon it; as the People <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to obey the Voice of</hi> Samuel, and cryed, <hi>Nay, but we will have a King over us,</hi> tho one would have thought, that he had said enough to beat them off from desiring such a <hi>change of Government,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.19.

The <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie a <hi>compleat and perfect Revelation.</hi> There is <hi>nothings New</hi> to be <hi>added</hi> by any one that <hi>cometh after.</hi> The <hi>whole Councel of God</hi> is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,</hi> so far as <hi>Eternal Wisdom</hi> thinks fit to discover it on this side of Heaven. God hath <hi>finished</hi> what he intended, and fill'd up the <hi>Volume of this Book,</hi> that the <hi>Man of God may be perfect</hi> by diligent Study, and Meditation in it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. There are no more <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired Authors</hi> to be lookt for; the Divine Commandment <hi>is not in Heaven, that we should say, who shall go up thither for us, and bring it to us?</hi> Deut. 30.12. Here is the Summ of all that we are to know; and they who <hi>seek</hi> any further, can expect only to <hi>lose themselves,</hi> in the <hi>finding of some false Light,</hi> designedly <hi>kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled</hi> by the Devil, and righteously permitted for their Punishment by God. 4. The <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word</hi> is God's <hi>last Remedy;</hi> and they that are not recover'd by <hi>this,</hi> must perish <hi>without Remedy.</hi> There are no Persons in such dreadful Circumstances, as they that <hi>live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sound</hi> of the Gospel <hi>unreclaim'd;</hi> for <hi>if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3. They must be <hi>finally lost,</hi> whom this Word is not bless't to <hi>save.</hi> There is no hope of a Soul being <hi>restor'd</hi> by other Means, when its <hi>Disease prevails</hi> against this; such as can bear <hi>hewing by the Prophets,</hi> without being <hi>cut to the Heart,</hi> have <hi>Iron Sinews</hi> that will <hi>turn the Edge</hi> of all other Weapons. You
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40872:99"/>may look upon them as Persons, whom <hi>no Balm in</hi> Gilead can heal, and therefore <hi>given over</hi> to Eternal Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. Beware of <hi>receiving the Word of Grace in vain.</hi> Ministers, as <hi>Workers together with God,</hi> beseech you most importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, that you would not <hi>so</hi> receive it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>All</hi> will be <hi>vain,</hi> if <hi>this</hi> be so; and therefore consider what you do, and how much depends upon it. <hi>Besist not</hi> the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions whereby God's Messengers are now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to <hi>bring you home</hi> to him; there will be none to <hi>succeed</hi> them, but <hi>Messengers of Wrath,</hi> and some of these will shortly <hi>fetch you away</hi> before his Tribunal, when you shall know to your cost, how precious <hi>rejected of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Mercy</hi> are. 2. Do your Part in order to the <hi>continuance of the Word;</hi> which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, unless you give it <hi>due Entertainment.</hi> You help to <hi>drive it out</hi> of the Kingdom and Countrey where you are, if you do not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it into your Hearts.</hi> Where the Gospel hath no <hi>saving Work</hi> to do, it will be <hi>sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> as was said to <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 22.18. <hi>Make hast, and get thee quickly out of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>for they will not receive thy Testimony concerning me.</hi> Let <hi>Moses and the Prophets</hi> be such <hi>Welcome Guests</hi> to you, that (as far as in you lies) you may <hi>encourage their stay</hi> here, till <hi>Christ's second Coming.</hi> 3. Let not <hi>Custom</hi> make that <hi>less profitable</hi> to you, which ought rather to <hi>increase your Profiting.</hi> It is matter of shame to us, that the <hi>freer course</hi> the Word hath, and the <hi>longer</hi> we enjoy it, we are naturally
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40872:99"/>the <hi>more negligent</hi> and careless of it. Some are <hi>willing for a Season to rejoyce</hi> in that <hi>Light,</hi> which when it hath <hi>shin'd a while,</hi> they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem and undervalue. The <hi>glad-tidings</hi> of Salvation would find better Reception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those that <hi>never heard</hi> them, than with such as <hi>have been hearing them may Years;</hi> as God told the Prophet, that if he had been <hi>sent to a strange People,</hi> instead of the <hi>House of Israel,</hi> they <hi>would have hearken'd</hi> to him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.5, 6. 4. Remember, that both <hi>they who preach,</hi> and <hi>you who hear,</hi> must in a little Time be both joyn'd to the <hi>Congregation of the Dead;</hi> and this will more influence you, than any one's <hi>rising from the Dead</hi> can. <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets live not for ever,</hi> but the <hi>Breath</hi> which they spend in your Service, will be quickly <hi>stopt;</hi> the Time is hastening, when all of you among whom we go Publishing the Kingdom of God now, shall <hi>see our Faces no more,</hi> till the end of the World, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.25. We shall <hi>not declare God's loving Kindness in the Grave, nor his faithfulness in Destruction,</hi> Psalm 88.11. And it cannot be long, before you arrive there <hi>your selves;</hi> therefore it greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves you to make the <hi>best use</hi> of our Labours, while you may, that after we have <hi>all</hi> quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Daying State, we may <hi>meet with Joy</hi> (and not with <hi>Grief</hi>) in the <hi>general Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>

               <p>Thus by God's gracious Assistance, I am come to the <hi>Close</hi> of these Discourses; <hi>God</hi> and <hi>your own Hearts</hi> know, how far they have been indeed serviceable or helpful to you.

                  <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> have here been <hi>set before you;</hi> the Portion of the <hi>Happy Beggar,</hi> and of the <hi>Miserable Rich Man;</hi> and I do once more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly urge you to make your speedy <hi>Choice.</hi> If you have gotten any good by all that hath been said, it will be seen by your <hi>unfeigned Faith in Christ,</hi> and by the <hi>genuine Fruits</hi> of that Faith in an <hi>Holy Conversation;</hi> for <hi>every one that hath heard and learned of the Father</hi> (which is the <hi>only</hi> Hearing and Learning to any Purpose) <hi>cometh to Christ,</hi> and is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by him, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. What therefore shall we say at last to <hi>him that sends us?</hi> What a blessed Thing would it be, if <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>Readers</hi> would give us Cause to say, we have <hi>perswaded and prevail'd also!</hi> If we could but carry back such a <hi>good Report</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you, as the <hi>Words which</hi> Moses <hi>return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord,</hi> Exod. 19.8.
